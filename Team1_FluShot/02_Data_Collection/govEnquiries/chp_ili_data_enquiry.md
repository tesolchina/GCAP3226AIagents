Dear Access to Information Officer,

We are students from Hong Kong Baptist University (GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government) conducting research on influenza outbreak prediction modeling. We have reviewed the publicly available ILI surveillance data at [https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/statistics/data/10/26/44/292/7071.html](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/statistics/data/10/26/44/292/7071.html) and seek additional information to support our academic analysis.

Based on the current data showing ILI consultation rates from Family Medicine Clinics and Private Medical Practitioner clinics, we request the following information:

1) Historical ILI data access
- Can we obtain machine-readable historical ILI consultation data (â‰¥5 years) with district-level breakdowns? The current web format shows weekly rates but we need structured data for time series analysis and modeling.

2) Additional surveillance indicators
- What other influenza surveillance indicators are routinely collected (laboratory-confirmed cases, hospitalizations, mortality) that could complement the ILI data for outbreak prediction models?

3) Data integration and forecasting
- Does CHP use the ILI surveillance data for any predictive modeling or early warning systems? If so, what methodologies are employed and are there opportunities for academic collaboration on model validation?

We will use any provided information solely for academic purposes and adhere to confidentiality standards. If certain data is not available through the Code on Access to Information, we appreciate guidance on alternative public sources.

Sincerely,
GCAP3226 Team 1 (Flu Shot)
