Dear Access to Information Officer,

We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University currently enrolled in the course GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. For our final research project, we are conducting an analysis of the Government’s School Outreach Programme for influenza vaccination.

To support this academic research, we kindly request access to the following information under the Code on Access to Information:

1.⁠ ⁠School-Based Vaccination Coverage Data   Annual vaccination rates over the past five years, disaggregated by:

- Student age group (kindergarten, primary, secondary)
- District (all 18 districts of Hong Kong)
- Vaccine type (e.g., nasal spray, injection)

2.⁠ ⁠Related Health Outcomes among School-Aged Children   Corresponding annual rates of influenza infection, hospitalization, and (where available) severe cases, broken down by:

- Age group and district
- Vaccination status (vaccinated vs. unvaccinated)

All data will be used solely for academic purposes, handled confidentially, and analyzed in line with ethical and privacy standards. We aim to evaluate the programme’s effectiveness and form evidence-based policy recommendations.

Please inform us if any part of this request is unclear or unavailable. We appreciate your support.

Sincerely,
Ywung Wing Yu
GCAP3226 Team 1
