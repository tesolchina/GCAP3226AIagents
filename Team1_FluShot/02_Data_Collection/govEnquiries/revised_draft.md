Dear Access to Information Officer,

We are students from Hong Kong Baptist University (GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government). We are studying influenza vaccination and outbreak modeling, focusing on the School Outreach Programme and district-level flu dynamics. To ensure our analysis aligns with government practice and available data, we seek clarification on the following (no personal identifiers required):

1) Data availability and access
- What datasets are available (and at what granularity and frequency) for: (a) ILI consultations, lab-confirmed influenza by type/subtype, hospitalizations/ICU, mortality (P&I), and vaccination coverage; (b) district- or age-stratified breakdowns; (c) historical coverage (ideally â‰¥5 years)? Are machine-readable formats or APIs available?

2) Vaccination and programme data
- For the School Outreach Programme, can we obtain annual vaccination coverage by school level (KG/primary/secondary), district, and vaccine type? If not, what aggregated indicators are routinely reported that we can use as proxies?

3) eHealth integration and modeling
- How many schoolchildren are using the eHealth app to track vaccination data, and what aggregated statistics are available from this digital platform? Additionally, does the Department/CHP currently use any forecasting or nowcasting models for seasonal influenza (e.g., time series, SEIR, ensembles)? If so, can you (i) share public documentation/links and (ii) advise how external academic teams may validate models against official indicators?

We will use any provided information solely for academic purposes and adhere to confidentiality and privacy standards. If part of the request is not covered by the Code on Access to Information, grateful for guidance on alternative public sources or procedures.

Sincerely,
GCAP3226 Team 1 (Flu Shot)
