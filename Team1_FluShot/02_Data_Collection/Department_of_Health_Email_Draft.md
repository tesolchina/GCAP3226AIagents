# Department of Health Email Draft - School-Based Flu Vaccination Data Request

**To:** Access to Information Officer, Department of Health  
**Email:** enquiry_chpweb@dh.gov.hk  
**Subject:** Request for Information under Code on Access to Information: School-Based Flu Vaccination Program Data Analysis  

**Dear Access to Information Officer,**

We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. As part of our final research project, we are studying the effectiveness of school-based flu vaccination programs and data governance practices in Hong Kong, with particular focus on protecting at-risk schoolchildren.

**Research Objective:** To evaluate Hong Kong government's data-driven approach to school-based flu vaccination outreach and identify data governance gaps for better protection of at-risk children.

## Priority Data Requests

### 1. **School Vaccination Program Design and Implementation (2022-2024)**
- School vaccination program criteria and selection process
- Resource allocation for school-based vaccination programs
- Number of schools participating in vaccination programs by district
- Alternative vaccination method availability (nasal spray) for younger children
- Sponsorship opportunities and private sector partnerships for school programs

### 2. **School Vaccination Effectiveness Data**
- School vaccination participation rates by district and school type
- Parent consent rates and refusal reasons (anonymized data)
- Vaccination site utilization rates and capacity data for school programs
- Campaign promotion reach and engagement metrics for school outreach

### 3. **eHealth System Utilization for School Programs**
- eHealth system usage for flu vaccination record-keeping in schools
- Data integration between school vaccination programs and health records
- Privacy protection and data sharing protocols for school vaccination data
- Stakeholder access to school vaccination records

### 4. **Health Outcomes and Impact Assessment**
- Flu infection rates among schoolchildren (vaccinated vs. unvaccinated)
- Hospitalization rates due to flu complications among schoolchildren by vaccination status
- Age-specific flu-related hospitalizations among school-age children
- Comparative analysis of school vaccination program effectiveness

## Specific Questions About School Vaccination Programs

1. **Data-Driven Decision Making:**
   - What data-driven criteria are used to determine which schools receive vaccination programs?
   - How is school vaccination program effectiveness measured and evaluated?
   - What data is used to identify at-risk schools requiring targeted vaccination programs?

2. **Alternative Vaccination Methods:**
   - What alternative vaccination methods (such as nasal spray) are available for younger children?
   - Are there sponsorship opportunities for alternative vaccination methods in schools?
   - How are parent preferences for vaccination methods (injection vs. nasal spray) tracked?

3. **eHealth System Integration:**
   - How is the eHealth system utilized for school vaccination record-keeping?
   - What data integration exists between school programs and health records?
   - How are vaccination records shared between schools, parents, and healthcare providers?

4. **Program Evaluation and Improvement:**
   - How does the Department of Health evaluate the success of school vaccination programs?
   - What mechanisms exist for continuous improvement of school vaccination outreach?
   - How are parent feedback and concerns about school vaccination programs addressed?

## Data Usage and Research Purpose

All requested data will be used exclusively for academic research to:
- **Assess school vaccination program effectiveness** and identify areas for improvement
- **Evaluate data governance practices** in school-based vaccination programs
- **Develop evidence-based recommendations** for better protection of at-risk schoolchildren
- **Improve parent engagement** and vaccination participation rates in schools

## Timeline and Contact Information

We understand that data compilation may take time. We would appreciate any available data by **November 9, 2024**, to allow for proper analysis and report completion.

**Primary Contact:** [Team Leader Name]  
**Email:** [Team Email]  
**Institution:** Hong Kong Baptist University  
**Course:** GCAP3226 - Data-Driven Government  
**Supervisors:** Dr. Talia Wu (Mathematics), Dr. Simon Wang (English)

## Additional Context

Our research is particularly focused on addressing the low vaccination rates among schoolchildren (only 18.7% in 2016-17) and the need for better data governance in school vaccination programs. We are also investigating how flu-related deaths and hospital overcrowding can be prevented through improved school-based vaccination outreach.

We are happy to provide additional clarification or modify our request based on data availability. Please let us know if any of the requested information is not available or requires alternative approaches.

Thank you for your assistance in supporting our research on school-based flu vaccination program effectiveness and data governance.

**Sincerely,**
