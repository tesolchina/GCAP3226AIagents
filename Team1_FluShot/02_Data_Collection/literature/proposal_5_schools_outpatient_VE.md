# Proposal: Outpatient Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) Study Using 5 Schools

## 1) Why This Study Matters (Problem & Significance)
- Outpatient cases represent the majority of influenza burden, yet VE evidence in Hong Kong is hospital-focused (e.g., Lee 2024). Evaluating VE in primary care fills a critical evidence gap for real-world protection against mild-to-moderate illness.
- School-aged children drive transmission; Hong Kong’s School Outreach Programme achieved high coverage in primary/secondary schools. Estimating outpatient VE by age and time since vaccination informs policy on school vaccination timing, formulations, and targeting.
- Post-COVID seasonality shifts and alternating dominance of A(H3N2)/A(H1N1) require updated, age- and strain-specific VE to calibrate outbreak prediction models and optimize resource allocation.

## 2) Objectives
- Primary: Estimate influenza VE against laboratory-confirmed outpatient ILI among students across 5 schools.
- Secondary: 
  - VE by subtype (A(H1N1), A(H3N2), B) and time since vaccination.
  - VE by age group and vaccine type (IIV vs. LAIV, if applicable).
  - Assess indirect effects/proxies at school-level (attack rates, absenteeism).

## 3) Study Design (Test-Negative Design in Outpatient Settings)
- Population: Students from 5 schools (mix of KG/primary/secondary) presenting to partnered outpatient clinics with ARI/ILI.
- Inclusion: Acute respiratory illness with onset ≤7 days; fever ≥37.5°C; cough/sore throat.
- Testing: Multiplex PCR for influenza A/B (subtyping) ± other viruses. Exclude SARS‑CoV‑2 positives from controls.
- Exposure: Influenza vaccination status (verified via eHealth/school records/parent-held documents), vaccine type, dates.
- Outcome: PCR-confirmed influenza (any type/subtype).
- Covariates: Age, sex, comorbidities, prior season vaccination, clinic site, calendar time (2‑week strata), district.
- Analysis: Conditional logistic regression; VE = (1 − adjusted OR) × 100%. Stratify by age, subtype, time since vaccination.

## 4) Data & Partnerships
- Schools: 5 partner schools (2 primary, 2 secondary, 1 KG/CCC) to capture heterogeneity in age and coverage.
- Clinics: 8–10 FMC/PMP sites near the schools for specimen collection and reporting.
- Records: 
  - Vaccination: School outreach registers + eHealth summaries (aggregated usage statistics), parent verification.
  - Laboratory: Public/private labs with standard multiplex PCR; subtype lineage where available.
  - Surveillance context: CHP ILI rates to align with epidemic timing ([CHP ILI weekly](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/statistics/data/10/26/44/292/7071.html)).

## 5) Sample Size & Power (Pilot Feasibility)
- Assumptions: 50–60% VE, 40–60% vaccination coverage, 15–25% influenza positivity among ARI.
- Target: ~600–900 outpatient ARI encounters from 5 schools across one season (yields ~100–200 influenza positives), sufficient for overall VE and limited stratified estimates; refine with interim monitoring.

## 6) Implementation Plan & Timeline (12 Months)
- Months 1–2: Ethics, MOUs with schools/clinics/labs; SOPs; staff training.
- Months 3–4: Pilot enrolment and process testing (N≈100); QC review.
- Months 5–9: Full-season enrolment during peak; weekly data QA; interim analysis.
- Months 10–12: Final analysis, reporting, policy brief, data contribution to forecasting models.

## 7) Data Governance & Ethics
- Consent: Parental consent + student assent where applicable.
- Privacy: De-identified analysis dataset; secure, access‑controlled storage.
- Data linkage: Minimal identifiers for vaccination verification; destroy linkage keys post‑merge.
- Oversight: University ethics approval; data sharing agreements with partners.

## 8) Risks & Mitigations
- Low case detection: Expand clinic sites; add rapid test triage; extend season window.
- Verification gaps: Multi-source vaccination verification (school/eHealth/parent docs).
- Selection bias: Enrol all ARI cases during clinic hours; adjust for healthcare‑seeking proxies.
- Temporal confounding: Two-week time strata; epidemic phase covariate.

## 9) Expected Outputs & Impact
- Outputs: Overall and stratified outpatient VE estimates; methodological report; anonymized dataset for modeling; school‑level absenteeism brief.
- Policy impact: Evidence to optimize school outreach scheduling and vaccine choice; informs CHP on outpatient protection to complement hospital VE.
- Modeling impact: Incorporate VE into nowcasting/forecasting and scenario planning; refine age‑/strain‑specific transmission parameters.

## 10) Resource Needs (Summary)
- Personnel: Coordinator, research assistants, phlebotomy/collection training at clinics, biostatistician.
- Costs: PCR tests, clinic reimbursements, data systems, logistics, incentives.
- In‑kind: School coordination support; clinic time; lab pricing.

## 11) Success Metrics
- Enrolment: ≥600 ARI encounters; ≥30% from each school level.
- Data quality: ≥95% completeness; results within 72h of collection.
- Scientific: Preprint + peer‑review submission; conference abstract.
- Policy: Brief delivered to CHP and Education Bureau; adoption in planning.
