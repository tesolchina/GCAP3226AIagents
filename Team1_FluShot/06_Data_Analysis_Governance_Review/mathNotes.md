# Mathematical Models for Flu Shot Participation Analysis

## Regression Analysis
- **Linear Regression**: Predict vaccination rates using demographic variables (age, income, education, location)
- **Logistic Regression**: Model binary outcomes (vaccinated/not vaccinated) with categorical predictors
- **Multiple Regression**: Analyze multiple factors simultaneously (accessibility, awareness campaigns, previous flu experience)
- **Time Series Regression**: Track vaccination trends over flu seasons and identify seasonal patterns
- **Geographic Regression**: Map vaccination rates by district/region to identify underserved areas

## Simulation Models
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Model vaccination coverage scenarios with varying participation rates
- **Agent-Based Simulation**: Simulate individual decision-making processes for flu vaccination
- **Disease Spread Simulation**: Model flu transmission with different vaccination coverage levels
- **Queue Simulation**: Optimize vaccination center operations and wait times
- **Policy Impact Simulation**: Test effects of different intervention strategies (incentives, awareness campaigns, accessibility improvements)

## Flu Outbreak Prediction Models

### Statistical Approaches
- **Time Series Models**: ARIMA, SARIMA for seasonal flu patterns
- **Generalized Linear Models**: Link flu activity to multiple covariates
- **Bayesian Networks**: Probabilistic modeling of flu transmission
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, Neural Networks for pattern recognition
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for improved accuracy

### Mechanistic Models
- **Compartmental Models**: SIR, SEIR, SEIRS models for disease dynamics
- **Agent-Based Models**: Individual-level behavior simulation
- **Network Models**: Social contact patterns and transmission
- **Spatial Models**: Geographic spread of influenza
- **Multi-scale Models**: Integration of individual and population dynamics

### Difference-in-Differences (DID) Methodology
- **Policy Impact Analysis**: Evaluate effectiveness of flu vaccination campaigns
- **Treatment vs Control**: Compare regions with/without interventions
- **Time Series DID**: Analyze before/after policy implementation
- **Spatial DID**: Geographic variation in policy effects
- **Causal Inference**: Establish causal relationships between interventions and outcomes

### Forecasting Approaches
- **Nowcasting**: Real-time estimation of current flu activity
- **Short-term Forecasting**: 1-4 week ahead predictions
- **Peak Timing Prediction**: When flu season will peak
- **Peak Intensity Prediction**: Magnitude of flu outbreak
- **Season Duration**: Length of flu season
