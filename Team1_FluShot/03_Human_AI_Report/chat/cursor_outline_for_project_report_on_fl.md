We need to create a v2 of this outline 
the key issue is what decisions of the government we should focus on to assess its data governance policies



---

**Cursor**

I'll create a v2 of the outline that focuses more specifically on government decisions and data governance policies. Let me first examine the current outline and then create an improved version.


Now I understand the key issue better. The current outline focuses too much on general analysis rather than specifically assessing government decisions and data governance policies. Let me create a v2 that focuses on specific government decisions and their data governance implications.

Let’s create v3 of the outline base on thoughts below
Maybe we should focus on school outreach because this is an area that needs more improvement- some at risk groups are here
Deaths caused by flu made headlines 
This is also where we can conduct some survey among parents 
eHealth; whether it has been leveraged to keep better records of flu shots records 
Any sponsorship over nasal sprayer among younger children 
We know the Education Bureau has helped Department of Health to encourage schools to promote flu shots - but is there systematic data collection to hold schools accountable /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/GCAP3226/GCAP3226AIagents/Team1_FluShot/Published letters/letters.md (take into account this letter

/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/GCAP3226/GCAP3226AIagents/Team1_FluShot/Department_of_Health_Email_Draft.md

let's write a v2 of this letter 
we should be concise and no need to reveal much info about our project
the starting point should be overall participation rate of schoolchildren of flu shots in 24-25, 23-24 and 22-23

we need to know what data has been collected to assess the participation rate
 
then we need to contact eHealth team (under Health Bureau) to understand how the eHealth system tracks vaccination records 
also some basic info like how many schoolchildren are enrolled in eHealth
