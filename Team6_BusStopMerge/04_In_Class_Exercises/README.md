# Team 6: Bus Stop Merge & Optimization

## Project Overview
Analysis and optimization of bus stop placement and merging strategies to improve urban transportation efficiency.

## Team Members
- [ ] Add team member names here

## Current Materials
- `GCAP3226-Topic2-BusStopMerge.md` - Bus stop merge analysis
- `Bus-Stop-Optimization/` - Optimization resources and data

## Project Objectives
1. Analyze current bus stop placement efficiency
2. Identify optimal merge candidates
3. Assess impact on passenger accessibility
4. Develop implementation recommendations

## Key Research Questions
- Which bus stops should be merged for maximum efficiency?
- How does stop merging affect passenger walking distances?
- What is the optimal spacing between bus stops?
- How can accessibility be maintained while improving efficiency?

## Data Sources
- [ ] Bus stop location data
- [ ] Ridership statistics by stop
- [ ] Passenger origin-destination patterns
- [ ] Urban planning and demographic data
- [ ] Accessibility requirements and regulations

## Methodology
### Spatial Analysis
- GIS mapping of current stop locations
- Catchment area analysis
- Walking distance optimization
- Accessibility impact assessment

### Optimization Models
- Cost-benefit analysis of merge scenarios
- Multi-objective optimization (efficiency vs. accessibility)
- Service level maintenance requirements

## Deliverables
- [ ] Current state analysis report
- [ ] Merge recommendation framework
- [ ] Impact assessment (accessibility, efficiency)
- [ ] Implementation roadmap
- [ ] Interactive mapping tool

## Timeline
- [ ] Week 1-2: Data collection and current state analysis
- [ ] Week 3-4: Spatial analysis and modeling
- [ ] Week 5-6: Optimization and scenario testing
- [ ] Week 7-8: Impact assessment and recommendations
- [ ] Week 9-10: Final report and presentation

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved operational efficiency through strategic merging
- Maintained or improved passenger accessibility
- Clear implementation guidelines for transport authorities
- Evidence-based recommendations for urban planning

## Resources
- Course materials: `../00_Course_Materials/Topic_Notes/`
