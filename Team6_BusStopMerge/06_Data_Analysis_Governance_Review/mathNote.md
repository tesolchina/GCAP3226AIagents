## Overview
This document describes how simulation can be applied to explore improvements from merging bus stops in Hong Kong's transportation system. The simulation framework integrates real-time API data with mathematical optimization models to evaluate the potential benefits of bus stop consolidation.

## 1. Simulation Framework Architecture

### 1.1 Core Components
- **Real-time Data Integration**: API-driven bus movement tracking during peak hours
- **Spatial Analysis Engine**: Geographic proximity assessment of nearby bus stops
- **Optimization Algorithm**: Mathematical models for bus stop placement and merging
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics for measuring improvement outcomes

```

## 2. Mathematical Models for Bus Stop Optimization

### 2.1 Spatial Optimization Model

**Objective Function:**
```
Minimize: Σ(i,j) w_ij * d_ij + Σ(k) c_k * x_k
```

Where:
- `w_ij` = weight of passenger flow between stops i and j
- `d_ij` = distance between stops i and j
- `c_k` = cost of maintaining stop k
- `x_k` = binary variable (1 if stop k is kept, 0 if merged)

**Constraints:**
- Accessibility constraint: `Σ(i) a_i * x_i ≥ A_min`
- Service coverage: `Σ(j) s_j * x_j ≥ S_min`
- Distance constraint: `d_ij ≤ D_max` for merged stops

### 2.2 Passenger Flow Simulation Model

**Flow Dynamics:**
```
F_t(i,j) = α * P_t(i) * β * A_t(j) * γ * D_ij^(-1)
```

Where:
- `F_t(i,j)` = passenger flow from stop i to j at time t
- `P_t(i)` = passenger demand at stop i at time t
- `A_t(j)` = attractiveness of stop j at time t
- `D_ij` = distance between stops i and j
- `α, β, γ` = calibration parameters

### 2.3 Service Efficiency Model

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- **Wait Time Reduction**: `ΔW = W_before - W_after`
- **Travel Time Optimization**: `ΔT = T_before - T_after`
- **Service Frequency**: `F_merged = Σ(i) F_i` for merged stops
- **Capacity Utilization**: `U = (Σ(passengers))/(Σ(capacity))`
