# Team 6: Bus Stop Merge Optimization - Project Comments and Updates

## Updated Requirements (v2)

### API Integration Requirements
1. **Bus Movement Tracking API**
   - Call APIs to track bus movement during rush hours
   - Focus on closeby bus stops to analyze coordination opportunities
   - Real-time data collection for optimization analysis

2. **Nearby Bus Stops Location API**
   - Call APIs to locate more nearby bus stops
   - Identify potential merging candidates
   - Spatial analysis for stop proximity assessment

### Government Inquiry Enhancement
3. **Transport Department Decision-Making Process Inquiry**
   - Ask TD specifically about their decision-making process for bus stop placement
   - Focus on criteria used for bus stop location decisions
   - Understand government rationale for stop placement and merging decisions

### Data Collection Strategy
- **Real-time API Data:** Bus movement patterns during peak hours
- **Spatial Analysis:** Nearby bus stop identification and proximity analysis
- **Government Process:** TD decision-making criteria and procedures
- **Mathematical Modeling:** Integration of API data with optimization models

### Key Focus Areas for v2
- API-driven data collection for bus movement analysis
- Government decision-making process transparency
- Real-time optimization opportunities identification
- Evidence-based recommendations for TD processes
