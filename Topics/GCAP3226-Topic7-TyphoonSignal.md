# GCAP3226 Topic 7: Typhoon Signal Accuracy Analysis

> **Course**: [[topic selection and group formation]]
> **Project Type**: Meteorological Policy and Data Analysis
> **Status**: API access established, initial analysis completed

## Project Overview
Analyzing accuracy of Hong Kong Observatory's typhoon signal decisions by comparing actual wind data from 30 weather stations with No. 8 signal criteria.

## Key Information
- **Technical Setup**: HKO API access to 30 weather stations established
- **Initial Finding**: Most measurements don't meet No. 8 criteria during signals
- **Policy Context**: Early announcements with time commitments (e.g., until 11am)
- **Impact**: Public safety and economic implications

## Research Focus
### Primary Questions
- How accurately do typhoon signals reflect actual wind conditions?
- What factors beyond wind speed influence signal timing?
- How can signal accuracy and timing be improved?
- Economic and social impacts of signal timing decisions

### Methodology
1. **Data Expansion**: Broaden API collection period and validation
2. **Accuracy Analysis**: Compare wind data with signal criteria patterns
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Geographic and temporal variations
4. **Improvement Strategy**: Enhanced accuracy recommendations

## Technical Components
### API Infrastructure
- **Data Collection**: Automated 30-station monitoring
- **Quality Control**: Sensor validation and missing data handling
- **Analysis Framework**: Statistical accuracy measures

### Investigation Areas
- **False Positives**: Signals without meeting wind criteria
- **False Negatives**: Conditions met but signals delayed
- **Geographic Patterns**: Regional accuracy variations

## Key Findings to Explore
### Signal Accuracy Issues
- Systematic timing or threshold problems
- Geographic measurement variations
- Economic vs. safety considerations

### Improvement Opportunities
- Enhanced prediction models
- Real-time signal adjustments
- Clearer public communication

## Available Resources
- **Technical**: 30-station API access and historical data
- **Expertise**: Meteorological and policy analysis support
- **International Examples**: Taiwan, Japan, Philippines systems

## Expected Outcomes
- Quantified signal accuracy assessment
- Systematic issue identification
- Evidence-based improvement recommendations
- Ongoing monitoring framework
