## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Path for Part 1

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Understand the Concept (5 minutes)
**Action**: Read README.md
```
Ask AI: "Please read /workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/vibeCoding101/Part1ReadingEditingFiles/README.md"
Then: "Can you explain the key concepts in simple terms?"
```

### Step 2: See an Example (10 minutes)
**Action**: Study InstructionsSample.md
```
Ask AI: "Please read InstructionsSample.md in the Part1ReadingEditingFiles folder"
Then: "Walk me through what this instruction file asks you to do"
```

### Step 3: Execute the Example (15 minutes)
**Action**: Have AI follow InstructionsSample.md
```
Ask AI: "Please follow the instructions in InstructionsSample.md and complete the task"
Then: "Show me the output you created in planGovEnquiries.md"
Then: "Explain your analysis process"
```

### Step 4: Create Your Own (20 minutes)
**Action**: Make a new instruction file using the template
```
Ask AI: "Please copy TEMPLATE_InstructionFile.md to a new file called myFirstInstruction.md"
Then: "Help me fill it in to analyze Team2_BusRouteCoordination"
Then: "Follow my new instruction file"
```

### Step 5: Practice More (Optional)
Try creating instruction files for:
- Analyzing different team projects
- Summarizing course documents
- Comparing projects
- Extracting specific information

## ðŸ’­ Reflection Points

As you work through Part 1, think about:

### For Your Reflective Essay:
1. **Instruction Clarity**
   - How does writing structured instructions change your thinking?
   - What's the difference between telling someone verbally vs. writing instructions?

2. **AI Collaboration**
   - When did the AI understand you well? When did it struggle?
   - How did you adjust your communication style?

3. **Government Enquiries Connection**
   - How is writing instruction files similar to writing government enquiries?
   - Both require clarity, structure, and specific requests
   - Both benefit from providing context and justification

4. **Professional Skills**
   - What transferable skills are you developing?
   - How might this apply to future work?

## âœ… Completion Checklist

Before moving to Part 2, make sure you have:

- [ ] Read and understood README.md
- [ ] Studied InstructionsSample.md structure
- [ ] Had AI execute InstructionsSample.md successfully
- [ ] Reviewed the generated planGovEnquiries.md
- [ ] Created at least one instruction file using the template
- [ ] Had AI follow your custom instruction file
- [ ] Explored at least 2-3 team project folders
- [ ] Taken notes for your reflective essay

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: AI doesn't find the files
**Solution**: Use absolute paths starting with `/workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/`

### Issue 2: Output is too vague
**Solution**: Add more specific requirements in the "Process" section

### Issue 3: AI misunderstands the task
**Solution**: Break it into smaller steps, add more context in "Additional Notes"

### Issue 4: Output format is wrong
**Solution**: Provide a specific template in the "Output" section with examples

## ðŸ“Š Self-Assessment Questions

Test your understanding:

1. Can you explain what an instruction file is and why it's useful?
2. What are the key sections of a good instruction file?
3. How do you specify where AI should read from and save to?
4. What makes an instruction clear vs. vague?
5. How can you improve an instruction file if the output isn't what you expected?
