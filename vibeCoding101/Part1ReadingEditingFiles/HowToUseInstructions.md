# Understanding Instruction Files - Student Guide

## 📚 What Are Instruction Files?

Instruction files are simple text files that tell the AI agent:
1. **What to read** (Input)
2. **What to do** (Process)
3. **Where to save** (Output)

---

## 🎯 The Basic Format

Every instruction file has three parts:

```
Input: [path to files or folder]
Process: [what the AI should do]
Output: [where to save the results]
```

That's it! Simple and clean.

---

## 📋 Example: InstructionsSample.md

Let's look at our basic example:

```markdown
Input: /workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/Team1_FluShot

Process: 
Read all files in the folder and analyze the flu vaccination project. 
Generate a plan for sending enquiries to government departments. 
Identify what data is missing and which departments should be contacted.

Output: /workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/vibeCoding101/Part1ReadingEditingFiles/planGovEnquiries.md
```

### Breaking It Down:

**Input**: 
- Tells AI to read everything in the Team1_FluShot folder
- Simple and clear

**Process**: 
- Three clear tasks:
  1. Analyze the project
  2. Generate a plan
  3. Identify data gaps and relevant departments
- Written in plain English
- No complicated formatting

**Output**: 
- Exact path where AI should save the results
- One specific file

---

## 🚀 How to Use It

### Step 1: Ask AI to read the instruction file
```
Ask: "Please read /workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/vibeCoding101/Part1ReadingEditingFiles/InstructionsSample.md"
```

### Step 2: Ask AI to follow it
```
Ask: "Please follow the instructions in that file"
```

### Step 3: Check the output
```
Ask: "Show me the content of planGovEnquiries.md"
```

## 💡 Why Keep It Simple?

### ✅ Simple Instruction Files Are:
- **Easier to write** - Less thinking, faster creation
- **Clearer to read** - You and others understand quickly
- **Better for AI** - Less room for misinterpretation
- **Faster to execute** - AI gets straight to work
- **Easier to debug** - If something goes wrong, easy to fix

### ❌ Complex Instruction Files:
- Take time to write manually
- Are prone to errors
- **Should be generated by AI, not written by humans!**
- You describe what you want, AI creates the detailed instruction file

---

## 🤖 Let AI Generate Complex Instructions

**Important**: Don't manually write complex instruction files!

Instead, ask AI to create them for you:

```
"Please create an instruction file for me:
- Input: /workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/Team3_Typhoon
- Process: Analyze the project, identify data gaps, suggest government departments to contact
- Output: /workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/vibeCoding101/typhoon_plan.md
- Add detailed steps for the analysis
- Include output formatting requirements"
```

AI will generate a detailed instruction file, then you can:
1. Review it
2. Send the instruction file path to AI
3. Get your results!

## 📊 Simple vs. Advanced

We provide TWO versions:

### InstructionsSample.md (Simple)
```
Input: [path]
Process: [brief description]
Output: [path]
```
**Use this when**: You're learning or want quick results

### InstructionsSample_Advanced.md (Detailed)
```
Input: [path with specific files listed]
Process: [step-by-step breakdown]
Additional Notes: [context and requirements]
Output: [path with format specifications]
```
**Use this when**: You need very specific outputs or complex analysis

---

## 🎓 Learning Progression

### Level 1: Use the Simple Version
1. Read InstructionsSample.md
2. Ask AI to follow it
3. Review the output
4. Understand the three-part structure

### Level 2: Modify the Simple Version
1. Copy InstructionsSample.md
2. Change Input to a different folder
3. Adjust Process description
4. Change Output path
5. Ask AI to follow your version

### Level 3: Create Your Own
1. Copy TEMPLATE_InstructionFile.md
2. Fill in Input, Process, Output
3. Keep it simple!
4. Test with AI

### Level 4: Let AI Create Advanced Versions
1. Don't write complex instructions manually!
2. Ask AI: "Create a detailed instruction file for [task]"
3. AI generates the complex version for you
4. Review InstructionsSample_Advanced.md to see an example

## 💭 Think About This

### Instruction Files are Like Government Enquiries!

| Instruction File | Government Enquiry |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Input: What data to look at | Background: What issue you're addressing |
| Process: What analysis to do | Request: What data you need |
| Output: Where to save results | Contact: How to respond |

Both require:
- ✅ Clarity
- ✅ Specific requests
- ✅ Clear purpose
- ✅ Professional structure

This is why practicing with instruction files helps you write better government enquiries!

## ✏️ Practice Exercise

### Try This:
1. Look at InstructionsSample.md (simple version)
2. Create your own for Team2_BusRouteCoordination:

```
Input: /workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/Team2_BusRouteCoordination

Process: 
[You write this - what should AI analyze?]

Output: /workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/vibeCoding101/Part1ReadingEditingFiles/myAnalysis.md
```

3. Ask AI to follow your instruction file
4. See what happens!

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Keep it simple** - Three parts: Input, Process, Output
2. **Be specific** - Use exact paths, clear descriptions
3. **Start basic** - Don't overcomplicate at first
4. **Practice** - Create multiple instruction files
5. **Iterate** - Refine based on AI's output
6. **Connect** - See how this relates to government enquiries

---

## 📝 For Your Reflective Essay

Think about:
- How does writing simple, clear instructions help you think clearly?
- What's the difference between verbal prompts and written instructions?
- How does this skill apply to requesting government data?
- What did you learn about communicating with AI?

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ Understand the simple format
2. ✅ Use InstructionsSample.md with AI
3. ✅ Create your own simple instruction file
4. ✅ Try the advanced version when ready
5. ✅ Apply to your group project

---

**Remember**: The best instruction file is one that gets the job done clearly and efficiently! Start simple, then add complexity only when needed. 🎯
