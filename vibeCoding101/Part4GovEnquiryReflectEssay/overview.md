in this part we won't write more programming codes 
students will be drafting their government enquiries under Code on Access to Info https://www.access.gov.hk/en/home/index.html
to help them we should crawl the pages above 
then students need to read some files and notes from earlier weeks and work on their projects
they should decide what data they need from the government in order to assess the government's data governance practices 
they should prepare instruction files and send the file paths to the agent via chat 
they should then review agent's output and provide feedback 
eventually they should have draft emails for the government departments and bureaus 
they should also have a note explaining how answers from the government can help them with their projects and a plan for the scenario when the government did not provide anything useful
