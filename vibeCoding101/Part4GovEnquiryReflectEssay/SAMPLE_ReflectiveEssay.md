## Reflective Essay on Drafting Government Enquiries

Through the process of drafting a formal enquiry to the Department of Health regarding flu vaccination data, I gained valuable insights into Hong Kong's data governance practices and the complexities of accessing government information.

I discovered that while Hong Kong provides substantial open data through data.gov.hk, many granular datasets require formal requests. This revealed a tension between transparency aspirations and practical limitations. Crafting a professional enquiry taught me the importance of specificity – vague requests are less likely to succeed. I learned to clearly articulate data needs, justify their academic purpose, and demonstrate understanding of privacy constraints.

Working with the AI agent proved instrumental in structuring my request professionally, though I found the customized chatbot tutor more helpful for understanding policy contexts. The AI assisted with formal language and completeness checks, but the actual data identification required my deep understanding of the project.

This experience transformed my view of data-driven policymaking. Access to government data isn't automatic – it requires strategic thinking, professional communication, and backup plans. Whether my request succeeds or not, I've developed skills in formal government engagement that extend beyond this course. Understanding both the possibilities and limitations of data access is crucial for evidence-based policy advocacy.
