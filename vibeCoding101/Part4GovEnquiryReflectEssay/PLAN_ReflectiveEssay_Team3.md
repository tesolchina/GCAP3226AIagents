# Plan for Reflective Essay 2 (Team 3: Typhoon Preparedness)

This plan turns the instructions into a concrete outline you can fill quickly while aligning to Team 3 materials and the rubric.

## Target
- 180–220 words (aim ~200)
- First-person, specific examples, critical reflection
- Structure: Intro (35), Body (130), Conclusion (35)

## Inputs to Reference
- Team context: `Team3_Typhoon/Project_Roadmap_Team3.md`
- Supervisors' discussion: `Team3_Typhoon/Typhoon Signal Decision Analysis_otter_ai.md`
- Instructions: `vibeCoding101/Part4GovEnquiryReflectEssay/INSTRUCTION_ReflectiveEssay.md`
- Sample: `vibeCoding101/Part4GovEnquiryReflectEssay/SAMPLE_ReflectiveEssay.md`

## Section-by-Section Prompts

### 1) Introduction (30–40 words)
- Context: drafting an enquiry to HKO under the Code on Access to Information.
- Purpose: support Team 3’s study of signal No. 8 timing vs data accuracy and public safety/economic trade-offs.
- Your role: e.g., Lead Researcher (Primary Data) / writer.

Sample scaffold:
"In preparing our Team 3 enquiry to the Hong Kong Observatory under the Code on Access to Information, I focused on clarifying the data needed to evaluate signal No. 8 timing decisions. This task framed my learning about transparency, communication, and AI-supported research."

### 2) Main Body (120–140 words)
Pick 2–3 of the reflection points and anchor them with Team 3 specifics.

- Data governance assessment
  - Open vs request: public criteria vs. internal decision logs, station-level time series near upgrade moments, SOPs/metrics.
  - Insight: transparency exists, but key evaluative data often require formal requests and precise scoping.

- Enquiry drafting experience
  - Challenge: preventing a "non-answer" (per supervisors’ warning) by specifying variables (stations, timestamps, thresholds, deviation-from-threshold), and the decision window (e.g., +/- 2 hours of the upgrade).
  - Communication: professional tone, citing Code, clearly academic purpose.

- AI agent collaboration
  - Helped with structure, tone, and checklists; chatbot tutor better for policy context.
  - Judgment: I had to decide what constitutes “accuracy” (e.g., weighted deviation near decision point) and how to justify the model choice.

### 3) Conclusion (30–40 words)
- How data strengthens analysis: enables testing the lead-time vs accuracy hypothesis; compares "The Reality" vs "The Ideal" model.
- Backup plan: use public HKO data, literature, and simulation if denied/partial.
- Personal takeaway: confidence engaging government professionally.

Sample scaffold:
"Access to granular wind data around decision times would let us test whether longer announcement lead times reduce accuracy. If access is denied, we will triangulate public HKO feeds and simulation. I’m leaving this task with sharper inquiry skills and realism about transparency."
