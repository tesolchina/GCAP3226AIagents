## Introduction

This reflective essay documents my experience engaging with Hong Kong government data access, drafting a formal enquiry, and collaborating with an AI agent as part of the GCAP3226 course. The process deepened my understanding of data-driven policymaking and the challenges of open data in practice.

## Main Body

Through this assignment, I learned that while some government data is openly accessible, much of the information crucial for policy analysis requires a formal request under the Code on Access to Information. Drafting the enquiry letter was challenging, especially in identifying the exact data needed and framing the request professionally. The process highlighted the importance of clear, respectful communication with public authorities. Collaborating with the AI agent was both helpful and eye-opening: the agent provided structure and suggestions, but I had to critically review and personalize the output. Compared to the customized chatbot tutor, the AI agent here was more focused on workflow and document generation, which developed my skills in critical thinking and digital literacy.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project strengthened my appreciation for transparent data governance and the value of AI-assisted learning. I am now more confident in making formal data requests and leveraging AI tools for academic and professional growth.
