let's create a jupyter notebook for students 
the first step is to say hi to agent and login to github 
account (if needed)  

part 1 
learn how to invite agent to read and edit files 
note: students can ask agent to read other folders in the codebase to explore project structure and existing materials
part 2 
ask agent to explore some API in data.gov.hk 
part 3 
ask agent to write web crawler for specific government website 
part 4 
ask agent to draft government enquiries 
part 5 
ask agent to write reflective essay 2 


note that we should not include any python codes in the jupyter notebooks 
only instructions and descriptions of what python codes are needed; then agent will write the codes for us with explanations 

also we should demonstrate how to write instructions in md and send md file path to agent
