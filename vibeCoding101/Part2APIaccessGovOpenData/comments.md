# Comments and Revisions

## Original Request ✅ COMPLETED

MTR is a good example ok 
but we actually need a sample instruction file that can leads to the outcome 
input: that MTR data gov link 
process: fetch ... 
output : ... 

also we should add some code block to execute the python codes generated with some visualization 
more importantly we should offer instructions for students explore other datasets in data.gov.hk related to their projects
the key learning is that AI agent can write Python codes for us as long as we are provided with the right info about API and locations of the datasets 

please revise the folder and jupyter notebook accordingly

## What Was Added ✅

### New Documentation Files

1. **INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE.md**
   - Complete template for students to use with AI agents
   - Clear INPUT → PROCESS → OUTPUT structure
   - Dataset categories from DATA.GOV.HK
   - Step-by-step guide for finding datasets
   - Fill-in template for student projects
   - Examples of how to write instructions

2. **EXPLORE_OTHER_DATASETS.md**
   - Comprehensive guide to exploring other datasets
   - Popular datasets by category (Transport, Health, Environment, etc.)
   - Real-world policy analysis examples
   - Step-by-step process for using any dataset
   - Technical tips for API integration
   - **Key message**: AI can write code for you with right info

3. **mtr_visualization.py**
   - Advanced Python script with multiple visualizations
   - Bar charts, pie charts, comparisons
   - Multi-station analysis
   - Saves PNG output files
   - Production-ready code

### Updated Files

4. **requirements.txt** - Added matplotlib, pandas, seaborn for visualization

5. **vibe_coding_tutorial.ipynb** - Added interactive sections:
   - "Try It Yourself" section with executable cells
   - Cell 1: Install packages
   - Cell 2: Fetch real-time MTR data (executable)
   - Cell 3: Create visualizations (executable with charts)
   - Cell 4: Compare multiple stations (executable with charts)
   - Learning outcomes section
   - Clear call-to-action to explore other datasets
   - References to new template files

### Key Features Added

✅ **Sample Instruction Template** - INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE.md provides exact format
✅ **Input/Process/Output Structure** - Clear workflow documented
✅ **Executable Code Blocks** - 4 new cells in Jupyter notebook
✅ **Visualization Examples** - Multiple charts showing data patterns
✅ **Instructions for Other Datasets** - EXPLORE_OTHER_DATASETS.md
✅ **Emphasizes AI Assistance** - Multiple mentions that AI writes code for you

### Learning Path Now Includes

1. Read the MTR example (existing)
2. Use INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE.md to structure requests
3. Run executable cells in notebook
4. See visualizations generated
5. Read EXPLORE_OTHER_DATASETS.md
6. Apply template to their own project dataset

---

## Student Workflow

1. **Identify policy question** → What do I want to analyze?
2. **Find dataset** → Search DATA.GOV.HK
3. **Fill template** → Use INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE.md
4. **Give to AI** → AI generates code
5. **Run in notebook** → Execute cells with visualizations
6. **Analyze results** → Use for policy report

**Key Learning**: Students don't need to code—they need to communicate clearly with AI agents!
