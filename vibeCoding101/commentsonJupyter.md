while we do not expect any python codes in the jupyter notebook 
we do expect some code blocks there with some comments on what each code blocks would look like 
later we'll send the jupyter notebook to AI for grading the reflective essay 2 
so we should have placeholders for essay 2 as well 
essay 2 won't be written with AI tutor (customised chatbot help)- it would be an essay written based on student input and AI assistance 
the topic should be about writing government enquiries 


for part 1 let's create some instruction files 
/workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/vibeCoding101/Part1ReadingEditingFiles read the files in the folder and add file paths to jupyter notebook and explain how these files can be used to interact with agent 
add more explanatory notes
