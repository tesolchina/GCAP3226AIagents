# Mid-Term Project Review Approach

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach for reviewing project progress in GCAP3226, based on the iterative development process demonstrated in Team 1's flu vaccination project.

## Project Review Framework

### 1. **Iterative Outline Development**
- **Version Control:** Track outline evolution (v1 → v2 → v3 → v4)
- **Focus Refinement:** Each version narrows focus based on feedback and requirements
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Ensure outlines align with course CILOs and supervisor expectations

### 2. **Government Communication Strategy**
- **Targeted Emails:** Separate communications for different government departments
- **Concise Approach:** Focus on specific data requests without revealing project details
- **Professional Tone:** Maintain academic credibility while being realistic about data availability

### 3. **Mathematical Modeling Integration**
- **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate mathematical models based on research questions
- **Data Requirements:** Define specific data needs for model implementation
- **Decision Focus:** Align models with specific government decisions being assessed

### 4. **Data Governance Assessment**
- **Current State Analysis:** Evaluate existing data collection and utilization practices
- **Gap Identification:** Identify missing data and governance limitations
- **Improvement Framework:** Develop recommendations for enhanced data governance

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Project Scope Definition
- **Initial Outline:** Broad project scope and research questions
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Ensure alignment with course requirements
- **Resource Assessment:** Evaluate available data and government access

### Phase 2: Focus Refinement
- **Specific Decision Focus:** Narrow to specific government decisions
- **Target Population:** Identify key stakeholders (schools, parents, government)
- **Data Requirements:** Define specific data needs for analysis

### Phase 3: Methodology Development
- **Mathematical Models:** Select appropriate models for decision optimization
- **Data Collection Strategy:** Plan government enquiries and stakeholder surveys
- **Analysis Framework:** Develop systematic approach for data governance assessment

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning
- **Timeline Development:** Create realistic project timeline with milestones
- **Resource Allocation:** Assign team roles and responsibilities
- **Quality Assurance:** Establish review and feedback mechanisms

## Key Success Factors

### 1. **Adaptive Planning**
- **Flexibility:** Adapt project scope based on data availability and government response
- **Iterative Improvement:** Continuously refine approach based on feedback
- **Realistic Expectations:** Balance academic rigor with practical feasibility

### 2. **Stakeholder Engagement**
- **Government Relations:** Professional communication with government departments
- **Academic Supervision:** Regular consultation with course supervisors
- **Team Collaboration:** Effective team coordination and role assignment

### 3. **Data-Driven Approach**
- **Evidence-Based:** Base recommendations on actual data and analysis
- **Mathematical Rigor:** Use appropriate mathematical models for optimization
- **Policy Relevance:** Ensure recommendations are actionable for government

### 4. **Quality Assurance**
- **Peer Review:** Team member review of all project components
- **Supervisor Feedback:** Regular consultation with Dr. Wu and Dr. Wang
- **Stakeholder Validation:** Government and community feedback on recommendations
