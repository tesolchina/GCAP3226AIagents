# Revised Project Roadmap - Academic Course Template

## Original Roadmap with Comments

Our main focus is to investigate the extent to which the government staff have made their decisions while being fully informed by data, or in other words, taking a data-driven approach. 
Our job is to identify a set of decisions made by the government and explore how these decisions could be made by a better data governance regime.  There are essentially two scenarios: the reality which we need to find out by approaching the government; the ideal scenario (as if we live a perfect world)- here the government's decisions are fully informed by the data and rigorous math reasoning. 

Talia and I have discussed two projects - one is about typhoon and another is about 

I think I talked about this in week 1, week 2, week 3 and week 4 lectures

comments on the doc 
let's not talk about specific projects  
we are in week 5 for group meetings  
week 6 no class students should go to the field to collect data
the semester is 13 weeks long 
they need to draft an enquiry email to the government under the Code on Access to Information 
the supervisors are Dr Talia Wu (math lecturer); Dr Simon Wang (lecturer in English)
each team has 5-6 students working on different projects 

the idea is to set up a template for students to work on we can fill in more details regarding specific project later 

students need to have actionable instructions and how to share the work 
students will write a report as a group - the report should be about 2500 to 3000 words (500 words per member)
the report should include some recommendations with evidence on how the government can adopt data-driven approaches 

there are two math models taught in the course: regression and simulation 
students are expected to use one of them

## AI-Generated Revision

Of course. As an expert in academic course design, I will revise the project roadmap to create a practical, actionable template for your students. This version is tailored to the 13-week semester, your current position in Week 5, and the specific course requirements.

Here is the revised project roadmap template.

---

### **GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government Research Project Roadmap & Template**

**Supervisors:** Dr. Talia Wu (Mathematics), Dr. Simon Wang (English)
**Final Deliverable:** 2,500-3,000 word group research report
**Current Status:** Week 5

#### **1. Project Overview: The Core Objective**

Your group's mission is to investigate a specific government decision-making process. You will analyze the gap between how decisions are currently made (**The Reality**) and how they *could* be made using a more robust, data-driven approach (**The Ideal**). Your final report will provide evidence-based recommendations for bridging this gap.

*   **Scenario A: The Reality.** Your team will investigate the actual data, criteria, and processes a government department uses for a specific decision. This requires primary research (contacting the government) and secondary research (analyzing public reports, news, and open data).
*   **Scenario B: The Ideal.** Your team will construct a mathematical model (Regression or Simulation) to demonstrate how the same decision could be optimized with data. This is your "perfect world" scenario, grounded in the quantitative methods taught by Dr. Wu.

---

#### **2. Detailed Project Timeline (Weeks 5-13)**

This timeline provides a week-by-week guide. Adhering to these deadlines is crucial for success.

**Phase 1: Planning & Initial Data Collection (Weeks 5-7)**

*   **Week 5: Project Scoping & Planning (Current Week)**
    *   **Task:** Finalize your specific research question (i.e., the government "decision" you are investigating). Define the scope clearly. Assign roles within your group (see Section 3).
    *   **Actionable Instruction:** Draft your enquiry email to the relevant government department under the Code on Access to Information (see Section 4 for a template and guide).
    *   **Deliverable:** Submit your one-page project plan and the draft enquiry email to Dr. Wang and Dr. Wu for feedback before sending.

*   **Week 6: Fieldwork & Primary Data Request (No Class)**
    *   **Task:** Officially send your approved enquiry email to the government department. Begin intensive secondary data collection.
    *   **Actionable Instruction:** Search for government annual reports, press releases, Legislative Council papers, and data on `data.gov.hk` related to your topic. Create a shared document (e.g., Google Doc, Zotero library) to log all sources.
    *   **Deliverable:** A copy of the sent email (with timestamp) and a preliminary bibliography of at least 10 secondary sources.

*   **Week 7: Data Consolidation & Model Selection**
    *   **Task:** Organize all collected secondary data. Review any response (or acknowledgement) from the government. Based on your data and research question, formally decide which mathematical model to use.
    *   **Actionable Instruction:** Justify your choice:
        *   Choose **Regression** if you want to predict an outcome or understand the relationship between multiple variables (e.g., predicting public facility usage based on demographics and location).
        *   Choose **Simulation** if you want to model a complex system with uncertainty and test different scenarios (e.g., simulating public response times to an emergency under different resource allocations).
    *   **Deliverable:** A one-paragraph justification for your model choice, submitted to Dr. Wu for approval.

**Phase 2: Modelling & Analysis (Weeks 8-10)**

*   **Weeks 8-9: Building "The Ideal" Scenario**
    *   **Task:** Develop your mathematical model. This is the core quantitative component of your project.
    *   **Actionable Instruction:** Work closely with your group's "Lead Analyst." Clean your dataset and run the model. Document every step of your process, including your assumptions, variables, and code/calculations. **Consult Dr. Wu during her office hours for guidance.**
    *   **Deliverable:** Preliminary model results (e.g., regression output, simulation charts) and a draft of your methodology section.

*   **Week 10: Synthesizing Reality & Ideal**
    *   **Task:** Compare the findings from your "Reality" investigation (government processes, secondary data) with the output of your "Ideal" model.
    *   **Actionable Instruction:** Identify the key differences. Where does the current government process deviate from a purely data-driven one? What are the potential consequences of this gap?
    *   **Deliverable:** A bullet-point summary of your comparative analysis.

**Phase 3: Reporting & Finalization (Weeks 11-13)**

*   **Week 11: Drafting Recommendations & Report Writing**
    *   **Task:** Based on your analysis, formulate 3-5 concrete, evidence-based recommendations for the government. Each group member should begin writing their assigned section of the report (~500 words each).
    *   **Actionable Instruction:** Ensure your recommendations directly address the gap you identified. For example: "Recommendation 1: Implement a regression model to predict demand, using variables X, Y, and Z, to improve resource allocation." **Consult Dr. Wang for help with structuring arguments and clarity.**
    *   **Deliverable:** A complete first draft of the entire group report.

*   **Week 12: Peer Review, Editing & Consolidation**
    *   **Task:** Edit the entire report for consistency, clarity, and tone. Check for grammar, citations (use a consistent style), and formatting.
    *   **Actionable Instruction:** The "Lead Editor" should merge all sections into a single document. The group must read the full report to ensure it reads as a single, cohesive piece of work, not five separate essays.
    *   **Deliverable:** A near-final version of the report, ready for a final proofread.

*   **Week 13: Final Submission**
    *   **Task:** Perform a final proofread and submit the report via the course portal.
    *   **Deliverable:** Your 2,500-3,000 word group research report.

#### **3. Group Collaboration: A Framework for Work Sharing**

To ensure accountability and balanced workload, assign a *lead* for each key area. Note: The lead is responsible for coordinating the task, but **all members are expected to contribute to all parts of the project.**

*   **Project Manager (1 member):** Tracks deadlines, schedules meetings, and ensures the team is on schedule according to the roadmap. Acts as the main point of contact with supervisors.
*   **Lead Researcher - Primary Data (1 member):** Manages the government enquiry process, from drafting the email to handling correspondence and documenting all interactions.
*   **Lead Researcher - Secondary Data (1-2 members):** Leads the effort to find, collate, and summarize academic literature, government reports, open data, and news articles. Manages the shared bibliography.
*   **Lead Analyst - Mathematical Model (1 member):** Takes the lead on implementing the regression or simulation model. Works closely with Dr. Wu. Responsible for writing the core methodology and results section for the "Ideal" scenario.
*   **Lead Writer & Editor (1 member):** Oversees the final report writing, ensuring a consistent voice, correct formatting, and proper citations. Works closely with Dr. Wang.

#### **4. Guide to Government Enquiries (Code on Access to Information)**

Contacting the government is a formal process. Professionalism and clarity are essential.

**Step 1: Identify the Correct Department/Officer**
Before writing, identify the specific government bureau or department responsible for your area of interest. Look for the "Access to Information Officer" on their website.

**Step 2: Draft Your Email Using this Template**

> **Subject:** Request for Information under the Code on Access to Information: [Your Project Topic]
>
> **To:** [Access to Information Officer, Name of Department]
>
> **Dear [Officer's Name or "Access to Information Officer"],**
>
> We are a group of undergraduate students from [Your University] enrolled in the course GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. As part of our final project, we are studying the decision-making processes related to [Your specific topic, e.g., "the criteria for issuing T8 typhoon signals" or "the allocation of public library resources in different districts"].
>
> Under the principles of the Code on Access to Information, we would be grateful if you could provide us with the following information:
>
> 1.  [Be very specific. Ask a clear, focused question. E.g., "What specific quantitative data points (e.g., wind speed thresholds, rainfall measurements) were used to inform the decision to..."]
> 2.  [Ask a second specific question. E.g., "Could you provide any public reports or policy documents that outline the standard operating procedures for making this decision?"]
> 3.  [Ask a third, if necessary. Do not ask for opinions. Ask for records, data, or documents.]
>
> This information is for academic research purposes only and will be crucial for our analysis of how data can support public administration.
>
> We understand that you may require time to process this request and look forward to your reply. Please let us know if you require any further clarification.
>
*   **What to do while you wait:** Government departments may take several weeks to respond. **Do not wait.** Proceed with your secondary data collection and model building immediately. The government's response will supplement, not replace, your own research.

#### **5. Integrating the Mathematical Models**

Your project must apply **one** of the following models to create your "Ideal Scenario."

*   **Option A: Regression Model**
    *   **What it does:** Explains the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps you predict an outcome.
    *   **How to apply it:**
        1.  **Identify Variables:** Define your outcome (dependent variable, e.g., `number_of_hospital_admissions`) and your predictors (independent variables, e.g., `air_quality_index`, `public_holiday_status`, `temperature`).
        2.  **Gather Data:** Find a suitable dataset from `data.gov.hk` or other public sources.
        3.  **Build & Interpret:** Run the regression. Analyze the coefficients, R-squared, and p-values to understand which factors are statistically significant. Use this to argue how the government *could* use these factors to predict outcomes and allocate resources more effectively.

*   **Option B: Simulation Model (e.g., Monte Carlo)**
    *   **What it does:** Models a complex system by running thousands of randomized trials to understand the range of possible outcomes. It is excellent for problems involving uncertainty.
    *   **How to apply it:**
        1.  **Define the System:** Break down your problem into a process with rules and variables (e.g., simulating passenger flow through an MTR station).
        2.  **Identify Uncertain Variables:** Determine which variables have inherent randomness (e.g., `number_of_passengers_arriving_per_minute`, `time_to_pass_through_ticket_gate`). Assign them probability distributions.
        3.  **Run & Analyze:** Run the simulation many times. Analyze the distribution of outcomes (e.g., "In 95% of scenarios, the maximum queue length was less than 50 people"). Use this to recommend policy changes (e.g., "By adding two ticket gates, the simulation shows that maximum queue length can be kept below 20 people").

#### **6. Final Report Structure (2,500-3,000 Words)**

Organize your report as follows:

1.  **Introduction (approx. 300 words):** Introduce your research topic, state your research question, and briefly outline the "Reality vs. Ideal" framework.
2.  **Methodology (approx. 400 words):**
    *   Describe your method for investigating "The Reality" (secondary data analysis, government enquiry).
    *   Describe your method for building "The Ideal" (your chosen mathematical model, data sources, and assumptions).
3.  **Findings: The Reality (approx. 600 words):** Present the findings from your investigation into the current government process. Use the secondary data you collected. If you received a government response, analyze it here.
4.  **The Ideal Model: A Data-Driven Approach (approx. 600 words):** Present the results of your regression or simulation model. Include key charts, tables, and your interpretation of the quantitative results.
5.  **Analysis: Comparing Reality and
