### **GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government â€“ Enhanced Research Project Roadmap**

**Supervisors:** Dr. Talia Wu (Mathematics), Dr. Simon Wang (English)
**Final Deliverable:** 2,500-3,000 word group research report
**Current Status:** Week 5

#### **1. Project Overview: The Core Mission**

Your group's mission is to investigate a specific government decision-making process. You will analyze the gap between how decisions are currently made (**The Reality**) and how they *could* be made using a more robust, data-driven approach (**The Ideal**). Your final report will provide evidence-based recommendations for bridging this gap, demonstrating the power of quantitative reasoning in public policy.

*   **Scenario A: The Reality.** Your team will investigate the actual data, criteria, and processes a government department uses for a specific decision. This requires primary research (contacting the government under the Code on Access to Information) and secondary research (analyzing public reports, news, and open data from sources like `data.gov.hk`).
*   **Scenario B: The Ideal.** Your team will construct a mathematical model (e.g., Regression, Simulation) to demonstrate how the same decision could be optimized with data. This is your "perfect world" scenario, grounded in the quantitative methods taught by Dr. Wu and powered by the AI tools introduced in class.

    *   **Task:** Finalize your research question and scope. Assign roles within your group (see Section 3). Begin brainstorming how a mathematical model could address your problem.
    *   **Actionable Instruction:** Draft your enquiry email to the relevant government department under the Code on Access to Information (see Section 4). **Use the AI Writing Assistant introduced in Week 4 to reflect on your project and potential data needs.**
    *   **Deliverable:** Submit your one-page project plan and the draft enquiry email to Dr. Wang and Dr. Wu for feedback.

*   **Week 6: Fieldwork & Primary Data Request (No Class)**
    *   **Task:** Send your approved enquiry email. Begin intensive secondary data collection and preliminary fieldwork if applicable (e.g., observing bus stop queues for transport projects).
    *   **Actionable Instruction:** Create a shared Google Drive folder (as provided) and a "Data Inventory" document. Log all sources from `data.gov.hk`, LegCo papers, news archives, and academic articles.
    *   **Deliverable:** A copy of the sent email (with timestamp) and a preliminary data inventory table with at least 10 secondary sources.

*   **Week 7: Data Consolidation & Model Selection**
    *   **Task:** Organize all collected data. Based on your research question and available data, formally select your mathematical model.
    *   **Actionable Instruction:** Write a one-paragraph justification for your model choice. Refer to the detailed guidance in **Section 5** of this roadmap.
        *   Choose **Regression** if you want to predict an outcome or understand the relationship between variables (e.g., predicting policy support based on demographics, as discussed in Week 2/3).
        *   Choose **Simulation** if you want to model a complex system with uncertainty and test "what-if" scenarios (e.g., coordinating overlapping bus routes, as discussed in Week 3).
    *   **Deliverable:** A one-paragraph justification for your model choice, submitted to Dr. Wu for approval.

**Phase 2: Modelling & Analysis (Weeks 8-10)**

*   **Weeks 8-9: Building "The Ideal" Scenario**
    *   **Task:** Develop your mathematical model using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. This is the core quantitative component of your project.
    *   **Actionable Instruction:** Use VS Code and leverage **GitHub Copilot** to help write your code, as practiced in Week 2. Document every step: data cleaning, assumptions, variables, and code. **This is where you apply the techniques from Weeks 2-4.** Consult Dr. Wu during her office hours for targeted guidance.
    *   **Deliverable:** Preliminary model results (e.g., regression output table, simulation charts) and a draft of your methodology section.

*   **Week 10: Synthesizing Reality & Ideal**
    *   **Task:** Compare the findings from your "Reality" investigation (government processes, secondary data) with the output of your "Ideal" model.
    *   **Actionable Instruction:** Create a table or bulleted list that clearly identifies the "gaps." For example: "Reality: Bus frequency is based on historical complaints. Ideal: Regression model shows frequency should be based on real-time passenger data and time of day."

#### **3. Group Collaboration: A Framework for Work Sharing**

Assign a *lead* for each key area to ensure accountability. The lead coordinates the task, but **all members are expected to contribute to all parts of the project.**

*   **Project Manager (1):** Tracks deadlines, schedules meetings, main point of contact with supervisors.
*   **Lead Researcher - Primary Data (1):** Manages the government enquiry process.
*   **Lead Researcher - Secondary Data (1-2):** Leads the effort to find, collate, and summarize public data, reports, and literature. Manages the Data Inventory.
*   **Lead Analyst - Mathematical Model (1-2):** Leads the implementation of the mathematical model, working closely with Dr. Wu. Responsible for the methodology and quantitative results sections.
*   **Lead Writer & Editor (1):** Oversees the final report writing, ensuring a consistent voice and proper formatting, working closely with Dr. Wang.

#### **4. Guide to Government Enquiries (Code on Access to Information)**

(The template provided in the original AI-generated roadmap is excellent and should be used as is.)

**Key Reminder (from Week 1):** Government departments can take 3 weeks or even longer to reply. **Do not wait.** Proceed immediately with your secondary data collection and model building. The government's response will supplement, not define, your research.

#### **5. Building 'The Ideal': A Deep Dive into Mathematical Modelling**

This section is your guide to constructing the quantitative core of your project. As emphasized in class, you don't need to be a math expert to do this. Your partners are your teammates, your supervisors, and the AI tools we've practiced with.

Your goal is to build a model that makes your argument tangible. You are showing, not just telling, the government how to do better.

##### **A. Regression Models: Understanding Relationships and Making Predictions**

*   **When to Use It:** Choose regression when your research question is about understanding *how much* one or more factors (independent variables) influence or predict an outcome (dependent variable).
*   **Course Connection:** This directly relates to the **Week 2 Waste Charging Policy survey**, where we explored factors influencing policy support.

*   **Step-by-Step Guide:**
    1.  **Frame Your Question:** Clearly define your dependent variable (the outcome you want to predict) and independent variables (the factors you think have an influence).
        *   *Example (Bus Frequency Project):* Predict `average_passenger_wait_time` (dependent) using `time_of_day`, `day_of_week`, and `bus_frequency` (independent).
    2.  **Data Preparation & Exploratory Analysis (EDA):**
        *   Gather your data from `data.gov.hk` or other sources into a CSV file.
        *   **CRITICAL STEP:** Before modeling, visualize your data! As Dr. Wu demonstrated in Weeks 3 & 4, the type of plot depends on the data type.
            *   **Categorical Data:** Use **bar charts** to show frequencies (e.g., number of responses in each education level). Use **grouped bar charts** to compare categories (e.g., showing the percentage of 'Support', 'Neutral', 'Oppose' for each education level). *Avoid using scatter plots for two categorical variables, as this just creates uninformative dots.*
            *   **Continuous Data:** Use **histograms** to see the distribution of a single variable. Use **box-and-whisker plots** to compare the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories (e.g., compare the distribution of `age` for those who support vs. oppose a policy). Use **scatter plots** to see the relationship between two continuous variables.
    3.  **Build and Interpret the Model:**
        *   Use Python (with libraries like `statsmodels` or `scikit-learn`) in your Jupyter Notebook. **GitHub Copilot can help you write the code for this.**
        *   **Focus on the Output:**
            *   **Coefficients:** These numbers tell you the size and direction of a factor's effect. (e.g., A positive coefficient for `perceived_fairness` means that as fairness perception goes up, policy support tends to go up).
            *   **P-values:** These tell you if a factor's effect is statistically significant (i.e., likely not due to random chance). A low p-value (typically < 0.05) is good.
            *   **R-squared:** This tells you what percentage of the variation in your outcome is explained by your model.
    4.  **Case Study in Action (Waste Charging Policy):** Your "Ideal" scenario could be a report to the Environmental Protection Department showing a regression model that predicts `policy_support`. If `perceived_fairness` has a large, significant coefficient, your recommendation would be: "To increase public support, government communication must focus on explaining the fairness of the 'polluter-pays' principle, as our model shows this is the strongest predictor of acceptance."

##### **B. Simulation Models (e.g., Monte Carlo): Exploring "What-If" and Managing Uncertainty**

*   **When to Use It:** Choose simulation when you are dealing with a complex process involving randomness or queues, and you want to test the impact of different policy choices ("what-if" scenarios).
*   **Course Connection:** This is perfect for the **Week 3 project idea of coordinating overlapping bus routes** or modeling typhoon impacts.

*   **Step-by-Step Guide:**
    1.  **Define the System:** Break your problem down into a step-by-step process with rules.
        *   *Example (Bus Coordination Project):* The system is passengers arriving at a stop, waiting, and boarding one of two bus routes.
    2.  **Identify Random Variables:** What parts of the system are uncertain? Assign them a probability distribution.
        *   *Example:* `passenger_arrival_rate` (e.g., follows a Poisson distribution), `bus_arrival_time` (e.g., follows a Normal distribution around the scheduled time).
    3.  **Run the Simulation:** Write a Python script that runs one "trial" of the process. Then, put this inside a loop to run it thousands of times (this is the "Monte Carlo" part). Each run will give a slightly different result due to the randomness.
    4.  **Analyze the Distribution of Outcomes:** Don't look at just one result. Look at the range of all your results.
        *   *Example:* After 10,000 runs, you can calculate the *average* passenger wait time, the *maximum* wait time, and the *95th percentile* wait time (i.e., the wait time that 95% of passengers did not exceed).
    5.  **Case Study in Action (Bus Coordination):**
        *   **Scenario 1 (Reality):** Simulate two bus routes arriving independently. Record the distribution of passenger wait times.
        *   **Scenario 2 (Ideal):** Change the code to make the second bus route's arrival dependent on the first (e.g., "Bus B tries to arrive 5 minutes after Bus A"). Run the simulation again.
        *   **Your Recommendation:** "Our simulation shows that by coordinating the two routes, the average passenger wait time can be reduced by 35%, and the chance of a passenger waiting more than 15 minutes drops from 20% to just 2%. We recommend the Transport Department implement this coordination."

##### **C. Room for Other Models**

While Regression and Simulation are the focus, your team can propose other models if they fit your project better. Discuss this with Dr. Wu first. Examples include:
*   **Optimization Models:** To find the best allocation of limited
