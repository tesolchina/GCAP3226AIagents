Some questions we may ask students to address 
below are the questions we asked some master students to answer in a different math course 

```
Before taking this course, did you use GenAI to help you write code? If no, how did you feel when you learned that GitHub Copilot can generate code based on prompt? If yes, how frequently did you use it to write code? ▪️

 Reflect on the roles you and generative AI played in completing this case study. What tasks did you perform? What tasks did GitHub Copilot assist with? 
 
 2 ▪️ How did using GitHub Copilot affect your learning process? Did it enhance your understanding of Python, or did it pose challenges? ▪️
 
 
  Discuss any concerns about using GitHub Copilot. ▪️
  
   In general, what’s the most challenging and rewarding aspect of coding with GitHub Copilot in this course? ▪️ 
   
   
   Anything else you would like to comment on the use of AI-assisted programming in this course.

issues to address 

1. the experience of using AI to write programming codes (especially for students with little to zero programming exp; also applicable for students from comptuer science background) 
2. human-AI collaboration: given the power of AI on performing various tasks, what are the contributions of human users (in your case, what did you bring to the table)  
    - specifically how human users contribute info about the project contexts (as LLMs have no access) 
    -  use AI as reasoning engines rather than information engines 
        - we expect users to provide contextual info including project details and replies from the government 
            (call API from open data portal- this is a good practice of getting external, quality data and feed it to AI)
        - one-shot or few-shot prompting: we offer quality examples for AI to imitate and emulate  
    - how human users validate the quality of AI-generated responses 
    - if you use AI to generate this report, you may document the process of doing so to address the issues above  
    - offer examples of how they raise questions to AI (prompts examples - preferably chat history)
