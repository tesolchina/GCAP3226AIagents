# GCAP3226 Teaching Plan: Weeks 1-3

## Overview
This note outlines the teaching plan for the first three weeks of [[GCAP3226_syllabus-md]] - Empowering Citizens Through Data: Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong. Each week consists of a 3-hour session, structured as follows:
- **Lecturing**: 30% (approximately 54 minutes)
- **In-Class Tasks & Group Discussion**: 30% (approximately 54 minutes)
- **Whole Class Discussion & Teacher Feedback**: 40% (approximately 72 minutes)

The plan aligns with the course topics specified in the syllabus and focuses on building foundational knowledge for data-driven public policy analysis in Hong Kong.

## Week 1: Foundations of Data-Driven Public Policy and Governance
- **Total Time**: 3 hours (180 minutes)
- **Objective**: Introduce students to the basics of public policy in Hong Kong and the role of data in governance, aligning with CILOs 1 and 2.
- **Session Breakdown**:
  - **Lecturing (54 minutes)**:
    - Overview of public policy foundations in Hong Kong: structure and role of the Hong Kong SAR government.
    - Introduction to data-driven governance: why data matters in policymaking.
    - Connection to United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
    - Co-taught by Mathematics and Language teachers to integrate perspectives on data and communication.
  - **In-Class Tasks & Group Discussion (54 minutes)**:
    - Task: Students form small groups (4-5 members) to brainstorm examples of public policies in Hong Kong that could benefit from data (e.g., housing, education).
    - Discussion Prompt: "What are some visible gaps in data transparency in Hong Kong policies you’ve encountered or read about?"
    - Groups document initial thoughts on a shared digital platform (e.g., Miro or Google Docs).
  - **Whole Class Discussion & Teacher Feedback (72 minutes)**:
    - Groups share one key idea or example from their discussion with the class.
    - Teachers facilitate a dialogue on the importance of transparency and accountability in data use.
    - Feedback provided on group ideas, guiding students to think about how data could address identified gaps.
    - Introduction to upcoming topics and relevance to course projects.

## Week 2: Applied Mathematical Models and Project-Based Learning in Public Policy
- **Total Time**: 3 hours (180 minutes)
- **Objective**: Explore how mathematical models support data-driven policymaking and introduce project-based learning concepts, aligning with CILOs 1, 2, and 4.
- **Session Breakdown**:
  - **Lecturing (54 minutes)**:
    - Introduction to applied mathematical models in public policy (e.g., optimization for resource allocation, statistical analysis for trends).
    - Overview of project-based learning: how students will apply models in real-world policy contexts through course projects.
    - Brief mention of relevant tools/software for modeling (to be detailed in later computer-based practice sessions).
  - **In-Class Tasks & Group Discussion (54 minutes)**:
    - Task: In the same groups from Week 1, students analyze a simplified dataset (provided by instructors) related to a Hong Kong policy issue (e.g., public transport usage).
    - Discussion Prompt: "What basic patterns or insights can you draw from this data, and how might they inform policy decisions?"
    - Groups note observations and potential policy implications.
  - **Whole Class Discussion & Teacher Feedback (72 minutes)**:
    - Each group presents a 2-3 minute summary of their data observations and policy ideas.
    - Teachers provide feedback on analytical approaches, suggesting ways to refine interpretations using basic modeling concepts.
    - Class discussion on challenges of translating data insights into actionable policy, setting the stage for deeper analysis in future weeks.

## Week 3: Data Governance and Its Impact on Public Policy Effectiveness
- **Total Time**: 3 hours (180 minutes)
- **Objective**: Understand the principles of data governance and evaluate its impact on policy effectiveness in Hong Kong, aligning with CILOs 1 and 2.
- **Session Breakdown**:
  - **Lecturing (54 minutes)**:
    - Definition and importance of data governance in public policy: transparency, accountability, and ethical considerations.
    - Case examples of data governance successes and failures in Hong Kong or globally.
    - Discussion of how missing or poor-quality data affects policy outcomes.
  - **In-Class Tasks & Group Discussion (54 minutes)**:
    - Task: Groups are given a short case study on a Hong Kong policy issue with noted data governance challenges (e.g., environmental data for pollution control).
    - Discussion Prompt: "What data is missing in this case, and how might its availability improve policy effectiveness?"
    - Groups propose potential data sources or collection methods to address gaps.
  - **Whole Class Discussion & Teacher Feedback (72 minutes)**:
    - Groups share their analysis of data gaps and proposed solutions.
    - Teachers guide the discussion towards practical challenges in obtaining data (e.g., government restrictions, privacy issues) and provide feedback on feasibility of proposals.
    - Wrap-up with a preview of Week 4’s focus on project topic selection, encouraging students to start thinking about policy areas of interest.

## Notes
- **Preparation**: Ensure datasets, case studies, and digital collaboration tools (e.g., Miro, Google Workspace) are ready before each session.
- **Flexibility**: Adjust time allocations slightly based on student engagement and discussion depth, while maintaining the approximate 30-30-40 split.
- **Assessment Connection**: Activities in these weeks lay the groundwork for assessments like reflective essays and project reports by building critical thinking and initial data analysis skills.
