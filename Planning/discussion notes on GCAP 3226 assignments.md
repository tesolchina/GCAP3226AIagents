**Project Logic:**
Students will evaluate the extent to which Hong Kong government staff have adopted data-driven approaches for policy making by:
- Providing **descriptive accounts** of available and unavailable data (data governance landscape)
- Investigating current **decision-making processes** through government information requests
- Developing **recommendations using mathematical models** (simulation-based, potentially hypothetical)

**Assessment Rubrics:**
- Model appropriateness for research questions

- **Oral presentation format**
- Potential **real-world audience**: Legislative Council members or invited lawmakers
- Creates pathways for students to deliver reports to policy-making stakeholders

## Reflective Essay

**Three Focus Areas:**
1. **Public policy analysis experience** - application of mathematical models
2. **Data governance insights** - evaluation of government practices  
3. **Effective communication strategies** - storytelling and stakeholder communication

Simon H WANG  0:01  
so we're going to go through all the assessment components of this course and consider how this different components or assignments will be assessed. So we're going to think about some specific aspects that we're going to look at for assessment rubrics, and based on that, we're going to finalize the grading and assessment scheme. So let's begin with the good project, and basically just think aloud and consider what questions the students may have. So basically, for the group project that would account for 30% of the final grades, students are expected to form a group of what's the four to six. So the ideal group size would be four to six, and they work together to write a report about 3000 words. Usually we actually would say it's 500 or something per member. So, you know, it could be, let's say, 600 per member or something, because if there are more group members, larger group, then they're supposed to write a few more. So yeah, so I'm thinking this is where we could ask or expect the students to write a report that can be submitted to the Legislative Council, upload it to their website. But in my past, basically my past experience, you know, very few students eventually did that, probably because of the time management. So just there's a delay over the completion of the report, and then we just feel like there's so much work that needs to be done before it's ready for the for the lawmaker. So I think if we want this to happen, we have to set a timeline that's realistic and also provide support so that the students will be able to get a job done. But I would still strongly encourage the teams to take that option, to send it to the lawmakers, to the Legislative Council, because, because that would increase the impact of of our work, but in terms of the rubrics itself, I'm just thinking, you know, because here we talk about, you know, the insights we can gain about data governance. I mean, I mean a very typical language center course, we will look at language content organization, but for a G equals like this, we probably will only look at presentation instead of instead of language, right? But then in terms of argument, or strength of argument, that's definitely important, and also the relevance of the argument, in line with the silo, that's also important. So what else

Speaker 1  3:50  
the whether the model is appropriate for the research question,

Simon H WANG  3:57  
right? The use of the selection and the application of the model,

Talia Wu  4:03  
yeah, whether it is implemented correctly, yeah, the accuracy interpretation, interpretation

Simon H WANG  4:09  
of the results, okay, all right, um, but I think there may be some questions we have to clarify here in terms of the exactly sort of the expectation of the reports. So I think that's still something we have to, we have to think about because, because because right now we are just saying there will be a report, or there's a project, but exactly what students are expected to do, we haven't spelled it out, right, so I think we need to clarify things like, What's The objective here? Right? So the objective would be, we take a specific public policy case and to evaluate to what extent the government staff have adopted the data driven approach for policy making. Now in order to answer that question, we have to investigate and first provide a descriptive account of what data is available and what data is not available, so the so called Data Governance landscape, and then We need to look at the current decision making process, through requesting information from the government staff, through doing some math model. I mean, for for a descriptive account, it's it's a matter of investigation, it's a matter of requesting data. But then for developing a solution or recommendation, a set of recommendation on data governance, and that's where the math model will be very important, because we we look at the problem, we look at the data available, or that might be available, then we're going to pick a math model and apply it to attempt to solve the problem. But that can be a hypothetical process, a simulation rather than a real solution, because we simply don't have the data right. But even just a hypothetical scenario or a simulation, it still has value, because we can then use this as the evidence to argue that there's so much more that can be done if more data is collected and analyzed so that will become the one of the premises of this project, or this, this assignment, okay, it

Speaker 1  7:15  
provides the quantitative perspective to the problem, rather than argument we should do this or that we have a more concrete, more quantitative way to measure how things will go, right?

Simon H WANG  7:33  
So we need to explain to the students in week one, this is the logic behind the whole course, and this is the reasoning, right? So we acknowledge the fact that the current practice of data governance and data driven reasoning or decision making of the government in Hong Kong is far from ideal. It's it's it's very limited. But then at the same time, we want to help the decision makers, the policy makers, lawmakers and the government staff, to see there's a better outcome and a better scenario, and hopefully that kind of better outcome or better scenario that we picture, we envision through some math work will help them better understand the possibilities and hopefully convince them there's a better way to do things. So that's, that's the that's the basic logic. And hopefully, based on our discussion here, we can clarify and, of course, taking the consideration the silo, we're going to have a more detailed instruction in terms of how to do the project, as well as the rubrics. Okay? So, so that that's the first first one, the second one is about in class exercises. Accounts for 10% of the of the final grade, and it will, we will use Jupyter Notebook. So do you want to talk a little bit more about what you have in mind here? Okay, so exercise

Speaker 1  9:31  
will be mainly about the some basic distributions we will be used in the case study. So it includes the binomial distribution, Poisson distribution and exponential distribution. So the Jupiter notebook will be like the prompt to to let me restart. So for the Jupyter Notebook, the existing content will be the very basic introduction for these three distributions, like we'll show the formula of the probability density function for these three distributions, and then we will have some task to our students to use From to calculate the probability of certain events to so through this process, hopefully students can get familiar with the very basic like the expression or what what this distribution looks like. And then we also have the small exercise, it's called in class exercise, which means we will have some small questions to ask students to to by using prompt write code to find out the answers to calculate certain probabilities. And then we will have again, the prompt to help students to write code to do certain to do very small simulations, which means to generate a random number from a binomial distribution with certain number of trials and also certain probabilities. So this is a like a small scale, possibly the smallest scale of simulation. It's like,

Simon H WANG  11:24  
okay, so in other words, the in class exercise would be an opportunity for students to learn how to write codes with AI assistant, and the codes will be run on Jupyter notebook, and then those codes would become a solution for some simple calculation problems that would involve calculation and simulation and some specific math models.

Speaker 1  11:53  
It's not model yet. I think it's just some distributions, random variable and its

Simon H WANG  12:00  
distribution, and how does that relate to one of the or the objectives? It will be some kind of analytical tools,

Speaker 1  12:12  
right? Because only they understand the distribution. Can they use it to model, say, the number of passenger arrive at different stops and the number of people alight at each stop, or the time interval between, say, between a bus arrive one stop and then next stop for the time interval, so that they can do the simulation for the real world problem,

Simon H WANG  12:44  
right? Okay, now, um, that's good. I mean,

Speaker 1  12:50  
this is inside in class exercise one, in class exercise two. I think the format is similar, but the content will be related to linear regression. Okay, we'll start with simple linear regression at the multiple linear regression, and maybe logistic or ordinal regression. This will be used to study the case two, which is using regression models to study the relationship among a set of variables.

Simon H WANG  13:18  
All right, I think that that's relates to another important question we have to also explain to the students up front is, what are the math tools that we need to introduce in this course that will become the toolbox for solve problems and and for that, I think we created a chat board. It's called mass model selector, or something, math model recommendation. So I think this might be something we want to introduce at some point. And in fact, we could move this to our own web page. We can set up a dedicated web page for introducing math tools. We put together several math tools or models, and then after some basic like, some slides and some introduction, maybe even a little bit simulation interaction, and after all that, there will be a chatbot embedded, so just like this, and people, after they enter the API key, they can talk to The Chapel, they describe the kind of problem they have, and then the chapel will recommend some math models. Does it make sense?

Speaker 1  14:53  
Yeah, but at this point, I'm not sure whether students choice will be beyond the two main methodology, we will introduce simulation and regression. I'm not sure whether some students will jump out of the box to use prefer other

Simon H WANG  15:12  
Okay. Well, if that's the case, then maybe the focus shouldn't be on selecting a model, but more about how to fine tune or adapt to the model to solve the problem. Is that, right?

Speaker 1  15:27  
So, which means we limit their choice of methodology, right? So they can only use either simulation or regression

Simon H WANG  15:35  
or subject to approval or

Speaker 1  15:37  
something. Yeah, right. And then the focus will be how to correctly implement, say, simulation in the research question the student raised right I think for from the implementation perspective, there are still a lot of problems. For example, in the bus number 56 overall. The simulation was done using a Python package called simpy. But if we introduce simpy in our class, time it will take, it can take a semester to teach only this simple package. Oh, okay, so I think if students decided to work on this, decide to use this package to run their simulations, then maybe in later in the group, like consultation, if they have any specific questions, or we can put sympy related context in the system prompt of this chatbot so Students can consult this chat bot to learn the basics, and if they still have problems to implement the functions, then they can ask for my help.

Simon H WANG  16:51  
Okay, sure. Well, that actually reminds me of another issue or something that we can talk to the students, especially with math majors, which is the possibility of turning this course project into an FYP project.

Speaker 1  17:11  
Yes, I think I am one of the FYP supervisors, and I do have a topic which is related to this course. So I think if students, I think year four student, year four student, if they choose this course and also choose that topic, they can work on the like group

Simon H WANG  17:36  
with. But the problem is, I don't think we will have many year four students, right? Because usually year four students, they have already taken their they have already taken their G cap. So, but we'll see,

Speaker 1  17:52  
maybe for year three students, we, I can use this as a gimmick, if they Yeah, in the last year, if they want to further extend this work to become a FIP, right? I have, I have the topic. They can choose, okay, they can be under my supervision.

Simon H WANG  18:10  
Okay, great. Okay, so, all right. So basically, the project, we already talked about, the project and the in class presentation is just an extension of the project, right? So it's follow the same structure, same framework, the same content, but it's going to be an oral presentation, and we're going to also, we're not going to promise, but we're going to say we have a plan that we might bring them to the Legislative Council or invite a lawmaker to come to us as the audience, and we're going to create different pathways or avenues for students to present or deliver their reports to the audience who may have impacts on the policy Making in Hong Kong. So that's, that's one of the that's one of the direction that we're going to have. Okay, so then we already done with the two major assignment and Wang you based on the discussion here to to generate the more precise instructions and rubrics now. And we also have done in class exercise one and two. So in class exercise is going to be graded, or just a credit, non credit,

Unknown Speaker  19:27  
graded, each, each, 5%

Simon H WANG  19:32  
I think, yeah. Okay. So, so, how are you going to grade it?

Speaker 1  19:37  
If they can calculate those probabilities correctly, or if they can use the correct command to draw the random sample ie simulation, then I think 100%

Simon H WANG  19:51  
so that will be credit on credit. Then so there won't be like so students either get all the credit or no or no credit. Am I right? Maybe

Speaker 1  20:00  
they only calculate one of the two probabilities, correct and 50%

Simon H WANG  20:06  
so then we still need the rubrics,

Unknown Speaker  20:09  
right or wrong? It's like,

Simon H WANG  20:12  
do we need a rubrics?

Speaker 1  20:15  
I think rubrics means the work is like, to some extent subjective. Okay, so we have the rubric to decide how much, how many points this is work is worse, but I think format is right or wrong. Probability is calculated wrong, then

Simon H WANG  20:35  
I see so actually, we might be able to use that AI module to grade the Jupyter Notebook, right? If we asked students to, like, upload the Jupyter Notebook,

Speaker 1  20:54  
yeah, my original thing is like, because Moodle cannot accept Jupiter notebook as the attachment. They need to zip it first and then upload the Z file,

Simon H WANG  21:08  
but, but juvenile notebook is simply plain text, right? Or they got

Speaker 1  21:12  
no no because it can show the visualization. Oh,

Simon H WANG  21:17  
but see, the thing is, what I have in mind is, what if? What if we ask students to upload the juvenile notebook to our system, right? And then we send a jubilee notebook to the large language model, and then our language model can probably grade or generate a report,

Speaker 1  21:47  
yeah, maybe because the number of registration is quite limited, I think if you open that general notebook, you just take a look and you know how many

Simon H WANG  21:59  
have. Okay, then.

Speaker 1  22:03  
And we also have a teaching assistant from my math department for this course. Oh, okay, yeah, I think he can do that. Okay, even I think for the in class exercise, he can go to the class and help some students raise their hands.

Simon H WANG  22:15  
All right, sure, PhD student.

Unknown Speaker  22:20  
And you see, I mean, course, Assistant,

Simon H WANG  22:22  
but so it's a full time start, yeah, oh, okay. All right, um, all right, so then we're done with that. What else I think

Unknown Speaker  22:36  
the reflective assay and human AI report.

Simon H WANG  22:38  
So these are the two we haven't discussed, right? So maybe we can quickly discuss for refractive essay. So that will be more about so we already got three focus here, right? One is about public policy, analysis, experience, so I think for Public Policy Analysis experience, this is going to be more about the application of a math model, right? How, how we are selecting and adapting a math model, or apply different math tools for problem solving, how we can gain insights about policy making and data governance by applying math. So that's more like relying on your expertise and also the training you can provide for students. Now for the data governance insights, this is going to be more about looking at the government staffs, data, governance practices and how we evaluate but I think the order looks fine and makes sense, because we want to think about the math part first, and also all the analysis before we take a step back and start looking at the actual data governance, which is the human decisions behind the scene, right? So math first, and then qualitative analysis later, and the third, in terms of effective communication strategies, I think the focus here would be because I think we talked about storytelling, right? So I think the communication here is going to be more about both communicating with the government staff, but then at the same time, after we have got some outcome and insights from our project, how we are going to communicate this to the general public as well as lawmakers, right? So that will be the communication part, which I think the order makes sense, because the third essay would be more broad, yeah, comprehensive, and it's like it will build upon the first two essays. Okay? So I think we are, we should be fine here, but in terms of the rubric, in terms of the rubrics, I think that there's the math part in terms of, well, apparently we shouldn't be assessing students use of math here, but it's more about communicating about the math, right, or communicating about the or reflection, right? So I would say very much, a lot of, a lot of the I um, assessment should be focused on, should we focus on the actual reflection? Okay, so reflection, for me, is a process of looking at things as kind of like a meta level. So, so basically, what we're focusing on here is, for example, you have done the math and you have done the analysis. Now you need to look at the process, the experience of doing that, and then started to to to to identify some lessons and insights that can potentially be transferable, right to to be applicable to other contexts. So so you're not just learning about this particular project or particular case. I think that's that's reflection,

Speaker 1  27:09  
yeah, I think it can also include, like, a description of before taking this course, or before learning this content, what, what the students were was thinking or doing right after receiving this message or have certain hands on experience, right? What has changed? What becomes different?

Simon H WANG  27:33  
Right? Yeah, I think that that makes sense. Um, okay. But then, of course, a little bit, oh. Another thing is, I think this is where I think the referral asset will be done with AI assistance. So, so it's more about we have a chatbot they can talk to and then and then. The key focus here is for the students to gain some insights through reflection. Maybe

Speaker 1  28:15  
the Chatbot can just ask them questions. Yeah, before this, what did you think? What did you do after this? What did you think? What did yeah, what's the most challenging

Simon H WANG  28:25  
part? Yeah, just, just keep asking questions and and then the chapel will probably generate some kind of outline or even essay, as well as what main takeaway, yeah, as well as a report. So I think the report would be generated by AI by assessing the chat history and the essay. So so this way we can, we can grade it very quickly based on the report you see. I mean, and, and if the students are not happy with their with with the chat history, or whatever, they can talk a bit more, you see, I mean, oh, they can start over, but that's not recommended.

Speaker 1  29:13  
So the assessment of this reflective asset will be based on their chat history, rather than the final AI generative report. Is that what you mean?

Simon H WANG  29:24  
Yeah, I think, I think what the AI is going to do is to look at the entire chat history well, because the thing is, what AI can do is to basically draft an essay for the students based on the chat history that can identify and integrate all the insights gained in the process, right? So what we're assessing is the students efforts and attempt to reflect and to gain insights with AI assistance, yeah. Okay, now the last part is human AI collaboration report, because AI is being used for writing codes, for brainstorming, for writing essay, and even for preparing the projects different different parts. So,

Unknown Speaker  30:33  
so what's the expected structure of this report?

Simon H WANG  30:37  
Yeah, we have a total of we have, we're talking about 2000 words, and it's individual, right? And we use the word portfolio, so I think it will be chat history plus reflection. So that's, the basic choice. Chat History, well, maybe an overview of the use case, first, just to describe why you are using AI for what's your motivation, what's your plan? Just a little bit overview, and then the entire chat history,

Speaker 1  31:19  
including those for generating reflective assets,

Simon H WANG  31:27  
either check history or a summary of the chat, which can be generated by AI. But the thing is, in order to more comprehensively and accurately assess human AI collaboration. I think reviewing chat history is very, very important. Is a, is a, is a must. But whether we are we ask AI to assess chat history, or we teacher directly assess the chat history. That's something we can figure out later, but, but what I'm saying is that if you want to look at students practice of talking to AI, we have to look at chat history so that that's that's a very important part of the of the assessment, then,

Speaker 1  32:25  
does that include the chat history with chat bot to say, choose mass model, all the chat history? Right? Yes. If that is the case, then I think we need to tell them in advance that all of our chat history will be recorded.

Simon H WANG  32:50  
Well, the thing is, for you know, if we're not going to use buy wise, almost like we're not, instead, we integrate the chat, chat board in our own platform, then what will happen is. What

Simon H WANG  33:16  
will happen is for each round of AI consultation, for each round that that student talking to AI at the end, there will be a chat history report being generated, together with a summary, and all students have to do is to copy and paste that to Moodle

Speaker 1  33:42  
so say it's very hard working. He talks to the traveler 10 times a day.

Simon H WANG  33:50  
Then they are running out of tokens from the university, because the university, actually my student Andy, is just checking usage limits, the 4.1 a monthly usage quota, 4.4 point one is three, 3 million. How

Speaker 1  34:12  
can this be translated to the number of words?

Simon H WANG  34:17  
It's roughly seven token or 10 token a word, which is actually a lot.

Speaker 1  34:25  
So if we divide it by that, that will be the total number of words,

Simon H WANG  34:29  
yeah, yeah, back and forth, including the AI response and what you write. I think it's quite generous. Actually. Let me check see the thing is, the students, once they use up their own quota, they can always ask another student for the API key, right? Because there are so many students, they don't use platform at all, so just go around and ask for other people's API key. Well, they didn't say you cannot loan your key to others,

Simon H WANG  35:13  
but, but the problem is, because I'm not sure whether, because I was running it on campus, it seems to work, but whether the API would would find the okay, if I run a program off campus, I don't know, you know API, Ito, could impose another restriction anyway. So let's, let's look at the polls. Restriction. Poll give how many points? 1 million, 1 million points. Well, actually, that's even more generous here, but, but, but, let's check the let's check the points. Okay, anyway, so going back to, going back to the, are we done? We've done talking with all the assessment, right?

Unknown Speaker  36:12  
For the last one, I think it's still quite vague to me

Simon H WANG  36:16  
in terms of how to assess. Yeah, okay, um, I

Speaker 1  36:21  
remember I asked. I asked Chabot here, I asked, I use air tools record to analyze and realize data to improve my storytelling, but from the perspective of instructor, what structure of this report is expected and why? And just give me this

Simon H WANG  36:39  
only introduction, and stop here.

Speaker 1  36:52  
So do we expect that AI would generate this report based on all the history, chat history?

Simon H WANG  37:01  
It's well, in a sense, I think the human AI report and reflective essay are quite similar. The focus and the expectation should be reflection, but the human AI report would obviously about more about human AI collaboration. So we are encouraging and expecting students to reflect on the process of them talking to AI and using different AI tools. And I think this is where we might want to look into some AI literacy framework. So if you go to UNESCO, there's a UNESCO AI literacy framework for students. So there's a 12 competency across four dimension, like human centered mindset, ethics of AI AI techniques and application and AI system design. So we might want to borrow this framework, like human centered mindset. So when we are talking to AI, how can we ensure that, like the human agency is still in control, right? So, so the humans are making the decisions, rather than AI drive the process in terms of ethics, responsible use the kind of techniques we learn in this course from engineering, how we leverage AI to write codes? I think, I think writing codes is actually a very kind of advanced techniques of using AI. So instead of just ask AI to generate text, we ask AI to generate codes, which I think it's something they can reflect on.

Speaker 1  39:27  
Yeah, do you really think this content can can be total 2000 words, five full pages of a full paper for

Simon H WANG  39:37  
individual right? So maybe we should cut down the word counts.

Speaker 1  39:43  
Yeah, yeah. I think 2000 looks a little bit scary, but,

Simon H WANG  39:47  
but, but if, if chat history is included,

Speaker 1  39:50  
then don't have to write anything.

Simon H WANG  39:53  
Yeah, exactly, um, yeah. Maybe, maybe we should, we should adjust the word count. Word Count. Here. Great. So, so. So.
