Our main focus is to investigate the extent to which the government staff have made their decisions while being fully informed by data, or in other words, taking a data-driven approach. 
Our job is to identify a set of decisions made by the government and explore how these decisions could be made by a better data governance regime.  There are essentially two scenarios: the reality which we need to find out by approaching the government; the ideal scenario (as if we live a perfect world)- here the government's decisions are fully informed by the data and rigorous math reasoning. 

Talia and I have discussed two projects - one is about typhoon and another is about 

I think I talked about this in week 1, week 2, week 3 and week 4 lectures 
let me locate the scripts

send the files to openrouter LLM 
select a smart but inexpensive one and ask for completion of this roadmap

comments on the doc 
let's not talk about specific projects  
we are in week 5 for group meetings  
week 6 no class students should go to the field to collect data
the semester is 13 weeks long 
they need to draft an enquiry email to the government under the Code on Access to Information 
the supervisors are Dr Talia Wu (math lecturer); Dr Simon Wang (lecturer in English)
each team has 5-6 students working on different projects 

the idea is to set up a template for students to work on we can fill in more details regarding specific project later 

students need to have actionable instructions and how to share the work 
students will write a report as a group - the report should be about 2500 to 3000 words (500 words per member)
the report should include some recommendations with evidence on how the government can adopt data-driven approaches 

there are two math models taught in the course: regression and simulation 
students are expected to use one of them

/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/ObSync/Vault4sync/GCAP3226/00_Course_Materials/week4_formatted.md
we should highlight some techniques and approaches of both models taken from here
