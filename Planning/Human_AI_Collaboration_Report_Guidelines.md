## Report Structure (1,000 words total)

### 1. Executive Summary (100-150 words)
**What to Include:**
- **Opening Statement:** Briefly state your overall experience with AI in this course
- **Tools Used:** List the main AI tools you used (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
- **Key Insight:** One or two main takeaways about human-AI collaboration
- **Impact Statement:** How AI affected your learning and project work

**Example Opening:**
> "Throughout GCAP3226, I used ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor to assist with data analysis, code writing, and report preparation. My key insight is that effective human-AI collaboration requires providing rich contextual information and continuously validating AI outputs. AI significantly accelerated my learning of Python and data analysis techniques, while I contributed domain knowledge about Hong Kong's transportation system and project-specific context that AI could not access."

### 3. Chat History Portfolio (Not counted in word limit)

**Purpose:** Provide concrete evidence of your AI collaboration process. This section demonstrates the depth and quality of your human-AI interactions.

#### Organization Structure:
1. **Chronological Organization:** Group by project phase (e.g., "Week 8-9: Data Collection Phase")
2. **Thematic Organization:** Group by task type (e.g., "Code Development", "Data Analysis", "Report Writing")
3. **Hybrid Approach:** Combine both - organize by phase, then by theme within each phase

#### What to Include:

**A. Key Chat Excerpts (with annotations)**
For each significant interaction, include:
- **The Prompt:** What you asked AI
- **The Response:** Key parts of AI's answer (can be summarized)
- **Your Annotation:** 
  - Why you asked this question
  - How you used the information
  - What you modified or validated
  - What you learned

**Example Format:**
```
**Week 9: API Data Collection**

**My Prompt:**
"I need to collect real-time bus arrival data from Data.gov.hk API for routes 272A and 582. 
The API endpoint is [URL]. I want to collect data every 60 seconds for 3 hours during morning 
peak hours (7-10am). Can you help me write a Python script?"

**AI Response:**
[Summary of AI's code suggestion]

**My Annotation:**
I provided the specific API endpoint and collection parameters that AI couldn't know. I then 
validated the code by testing it with a small sample, and modified the error handling based 
on actual API response patterns. This interaction taught me about rate limiting and API 
authentication, which I then explained back to AI to refine the solution.
```

**B. Prompt Examples (Show Your Prompting Skills)**
Include 3-5 examples of your best prompts that demonstrate:
- **Context-Rich Prompting:** How you provided project-specific information
- **Few-Shot Learning:** Examples where you provided quality examples for AI to emulate
- **Iterative Refinement:** How you improved prompts through multiple iterations
- **Validation Questions:** How you asked AI to verify its own outputs

**C. Failed Attempts and Adaptations**
Document when AI didn't help and how you adapted:
- What didn't work and why
- How you modified your approach
- What you learned from the failure

**D. Breakthrough Moments**
Highlight significant moments where AI collaboration led to important insights or solutions.

- Example: "I shared government email responses and API documentation that informed AI's code suggestions."

**2. Using AI as a Reasoning Engine, Not Just an Information Engine:**
- Example: "Instead of asking AI to generate generic code, I provided specific project requirements, sample data structures, and expected outputs, then asked AI to reason through the solution."
- Example: "I used one-shot prompting by providing a high-quality example of API data collection code, then asked AI to adapt it for my specific use case."

**3. Quality Validation and Critical Evaluation:**
- Example: "I always tested AI-generated code with real data before using it, catching several errors that AI missed."
- Example: "I cross-referenced AI's statistical interpretations with academic sources and course materials to ensure accuracy."

**4. Iterative Refinement:**
- Example: "I used AI's initial suggestions as starting points, then refined them through multiple iterations based on actual project needs."
