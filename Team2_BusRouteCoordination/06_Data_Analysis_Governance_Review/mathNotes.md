# Mathematical Models for Bus Route Coordination Analysis

## Regression Analysis
- **Linear Regression**: Predict passenger demand using time, weather, events, and route characteristics
- **Multiple Regression**: Analyze factors affecting route efficiency (frequency, overlap, passenger load)
- **Time Series Regression**: Model ridership patterns across different time periods and seasons
- **Spatial Regression**: Analyze route performance by geographic location and demographic factors
- **Logistic Regression**: Predict route success/failure based on coordination effectiveness

## Simulation Models
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Model passenger demand variability and route performance under uncertainty
- **Agent-Based Simulation**: Simulate passenger behavior and route choice decisions
- **Queue Simulation**: Model bus stops and passenger boarding/alighting processes
- **Network Flow Simulation**: Optimize bus route coordination and minimize overlaps
- **Traffic Simulation**: Model bus movement through traffic conditions and signal timing

## Data Requirements
- **For Regression**: Historical ridership data, route performance metrics, demographic data, weather records
- **For Simulation**: Real-time GPS data, passenger boarding data, traffic patterns, route schedules, stop locations
