Dear Access to Information Officer,

I am a student at Hong Kong Baptist University studying the course 'Empowering Citizens through Data: Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong'. We are writing to seek clarification regarding the Transport Department's specific decisions and data availability for coordinating overlapping bus routes from different operators.

After our research, we have observed that KMB route 272A and Citybus route 582 share eight overlapping stops. We are particularly interested in understanding the Transport Department's decision-making process regarding coordination of such overlapping routes. We would be grateful if you could advise on the following:

### Specific Coordination Decisions

1. **What specific decisions has the Transport Department made regarding coordination of overlapping routes from different operators (such as KMB 272A and Citybus 582)?**

2. **What factors does the Transport Department consider when deciding whether to coordinate overlapping routes from different operators?**

3. **Are there specific policies or guidelines that determine when the Transport Department will coordinate overlapping routes versus when it will not?**

### Data Availability and Access

4. **What data does the Transport Department have access to for making coordination decisions (e.g., passenger demand data, route performance metrics, coordination algorithms)?**

5. **How does the Transport Department collect and analyze data to inform coordination decisions between different operators?**

6. **What data gaps, if any, exist in the Transport Department's ability to make informed coordination decisions?**

### Decision-Making Process

7. **What is the Transport Department's decision-making process for determining whether to coordinate overlapping routes from different operators?**

8. **Who is involved in making coordination decisions, and what criteria are used to evaluate coordination options?**

9. **How does the Transport Department assess the impact of coordination decisions on passenger experience and operational efficiency?**

### Current Coordination Status

10. **What is the Transport Department's current approach to coordinating overlapping routes from different operators?**

11. **Are there any ongoing initiatives or plans to improve coordination between different operators on overlapping routes?**

If available, we would also appreciate any data or references (e.g., decision-making frameworks, coordination policies, or impact assessments) relevant to the Transport Department's coordination decisions for overlapping routes, and information on any planned reviews or policy adjustments.

Thank you for your attention. We look forward to your response and would be happy to provide further details if helpful.

Yours faithfully,

[TEAM MEMBER NAME]
