2. **Calculate Overlap:** Determine overlap count and percentage
3. **Analyze Coordination Potential:** Assess coordination opportunities

## 📊 **Expected Analysis Results**

### **Route Similarity Assessment**
- **Origin:** Both routes likely start from 大學站 (University Station)
- **Destination:** Both routes likely serve 大埔 (Tai Po) area
- **Service Type:** Both likely regular services
- **Route Pattern:** Similar service patterns expected

### **Expected Overlap Pattern**
Based on route naming (272A vs 272K), these routes likely have:

#### **High Overlap Probability (80-90%)**
- **Common Origin:** 大學站 (University Station)
- **Common Destination:** 大埔 (Tai Po) area
- **Shared Stops:** Major stops along the route
- **Service Redundancy:** Alternative routes serving same corridor

#### **Potential Overlapping Stops**
1. **大學站 (University Station)** - Common origin
2. **科學園 (Science Park)** - Major intermediate stop
3. **大埔中心 (Tai Po Central)** - Major destination area
4. **大埔墟站 (Tai Po Market Station)** - Final destination area
