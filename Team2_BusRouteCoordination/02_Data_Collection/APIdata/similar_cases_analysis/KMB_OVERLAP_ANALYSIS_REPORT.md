- **Route 3 & 6:** High coordination potential (75% overlap)
- **Service Optimization:** Potential for coordinated scheduling
- **Passenger Benefits:** Reduced waiting times through coordination

### **3. Operational Implications**
- **Service Efficiency:** Overlapping routes may indicate service redundancy
- **Resource Optimization:** Coordination could improve resource utilization
- **Passenger Experience:** Coordinated services could improve passenger experience

## üîß **Technical Analysis**

### **Overlap Detection Algorithm**
```python
def detect_kmb_route_overlaps(route1, route2):
    """
    Detect overlaps between two KMB routes
    """
    # Get stops for both routes
    stops1 = get_route_stops(route1)
    stops2 = get_route_stops(route2)
    
    # Find common stops
    common_stops = set(stops1) & set(stops2)
    
    # Calculate overlap metrics
    overlap_percentage = len(common_stops) / min(len(stops1), len(stops2))
    overlap_count = len(common_stops)
    
    return {
        "common_stops": list(common_stops),
        "overlap_count": overlap_count,
