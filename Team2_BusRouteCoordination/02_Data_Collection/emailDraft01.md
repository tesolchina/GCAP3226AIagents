Subject: Enquiry on approval criteria and coordination for overlapping bus routes (KMB 272A and Citybus 582)

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a student at Hong Kong Baptist University studying the course ‘Empowering Citizens through Data: Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong. We are writing to seek clarification regarding the Government’s approach to approving and coordinating franchised bus services where there is notable overlap between routes.

After our research, we have observed that KMB route 272A and Citybus route 582 share eight overlapping stops. In light of this, we would be grateful if you could advise on the following:

Basis for route approval

On what criteria and data does the Government base its approval for the operation of a bus route (e.g., passenger demand, network coverage, capacity and headway, duplication thresholds, road space and environmental considerations, interchange opportunities)?

How are overlaps between different operators’ routes assessed during approval and subsequent reviews?

Are there publicly available guidelines or policies that set out these criteria, and where can they be accessed?

Consideration of overlapping stops and consultation with operators

When setting up or approving bus stops and routing, has the Government considered the potential problems arising from multiple routes sharing a significant number of stops?

To what extent does the Government consult and coordinate with the relevant bus companies on route design, stop placement, and overlap management?

Headway coordination and passenger waiting time

We have noticed that the two routes often arrive in close succession at the overlapping stops, which does not shorten average passenger waiting time. Does the Government require or facilitate timetable coordination or headway staggering between operators on overlapping segments?

Are there monitoring mechanisms and improvement measures (e.g., schedule adjustments, operational directives) to reduce bus bunching and improve effective service frequency for passengers?

If available, we would also appreciate any data or references (e.g., scheduled headways, load factors, or corridor-level assessments) relevant to the overlapping section of KMB 272A and Citybus 582, and information on any planned reviews or service adjustments.

Thank you for your attention. We look forward to your response and would be happy to provide further details if helpful.

Yours faithfully,

Chan Hei Tung

Subject: Enquiry on overlapping services and planning criteria for KMB 272A and Citybus 582

Dear KMB and Citybus teams,

I am a student at Hong Kong Baptist University studying the course ‘Empowering Citizens through Data: Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong. We are writing to seek clarification regarding service planning and coordination where your routes overlap.

After our research, we have observed that KMB route 272A and Citybus route 582 share eight overlapping stops. In light of this, could you please advise on the following:

Government approval basis

From your perspective as franchised operators, on what criteria and data does the Government base its approval for the operation of a bus route?

What information do you typically provide to the Government during route proposal or review (e.g., demand analysis, coverage gaps, headway/capacity, road space/environmental considerations)?

If available, please point us to any public guidelines or documents that set out these criteria.

Overlapping stops and consultation

When bus stops and routing are set up or adjusted, has the Government considered the potential issues arising from multiple routes sharing a significant number of stops?

To what extent do you discuss and coordinate with the Government (and with each other) on stop placement, overlap management, and stop rationalisation?

Headway coordination and passenger waiting time

We have noticed that the two routes often arrive in close succession at the overlapping stops, which does not shorten average passenger waiting time. Do you currently coordinate timetables or stagger headways on the overlapping section?

What measures (e.g., dispatching controls, holding strategies, timetable adjustments) are used to reduce bunching and improve the effective combined frequency for passengers?

Your internal criteria for new routes and stop planning

What criteria do you consider when planning new routes and determining bus stop locations (e.g., passenger demand, stop spacing and safety, accessibility, interchange connectivity, operational constraints)?

Are there internal planning guidelines you can share, or summaries of how these criteria were applied to routes 272A and 582?

If helpful, we can provide the list of the eight overlapping stops we identified for your verification. We would also appreciate any data or references (e.g., scheduled headways, load factors, corridor-level assessments) relevant to the overlapping section, and information on any planned reviews or adjustments.

Thank you for your attention. We look forward to your response and are happy to discuss further.

Yours faithfully,

Chan Hei Tung
