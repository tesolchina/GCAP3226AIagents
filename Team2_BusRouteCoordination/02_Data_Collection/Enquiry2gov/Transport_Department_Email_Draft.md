Dear Access to Information Officer,

I am a student at Hong Kong Baptist University studying the course 'Empowering Citizens through Data: Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong'. We are writing to seek clarification regarding the Transport Department's awareness of coordination opportunities and general principles for considering existing routes when approving new ones.

## Specific Case Analysis

Based on our comprehensive analysis of Hong Kong's bus route data, we have identified a significant coordination opportunity between:

**KMB Route 272A**: University Station → Pak Shek Kok (白石角)
**Citybus Route 582**: Pak Shek Kok (白石角) → Sai Sha and Shap Sze Heung

### Key Findings:
- **Connection Point**: Pak Shek Kok serves as a critical transfer point
- **Service Type**: Transfer connection (not direct overlap)
- **Potential Benefit**: Seamless University to Sai Sha connectivity
- **Priority Level**: CRITICAL - Major connectivity enhancement opportunity
- **Expected Impact**: 30% reduction in University-Sai Sha travel time through coordinated transfers

Our analysis also identified **143 common route numbers** between KMB and Citybus operators, and **15,079 geographic matches**, indicating extensive opportunities for system-wide coordination.

We are particularly interested in understanding whether the Transport Department is aware of such coordination opportunities and what general principles guide their consideration of existing routes during new route approvals. We would be grateful if you could advise on the following:

### Key Questions

1. **Is the Transport Department aware of coordination opportunities between routes from different operators, particularly the KMB 272A and Citybus 582 transfer connection at Pak Shek Kok?**

2. **What general principles does the Transport Department follow when considering existing routes during new route approvals?**

3. **How does the Transport Department identify and evaluate coordination opportunities between different operators?**

4. **What processes or systems does the Transport Department use to recognize potential coordination benefits?**

5. **Are there any ongoing initiatives or plans to improve coordination between different operators on overlapping or connecting routes?**

If available, we would also appreciate any data or references (e.g., awareness frameworks, general principles for route approvals, or coordination opportunity assessments) relevant to the Transport Department's awareness and consideration of coordination opportunities, particularly regarding the 272A-582 connection and the broader system of 143 common route numbers identified in our analysis.

Thank you for your attention. We look forward to your response and would be happy to provide further details if helpful.

Yours faithfully,
