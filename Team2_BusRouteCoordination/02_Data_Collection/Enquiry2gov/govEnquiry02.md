Dear Access to Information Officer,

I am a student at Hong Kong Baptist University studying the course 'Empowering Citizens through Data: Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong'. We are writing to seek clarification regarding the Transport Department's awareness of coordination opportunities and general principles for considering existing routes when approving new ones.

## Specific Case Analysis: KMB 272A and Citybus 582

Based on our comprehensive analysis of Hong Kong's bus route data, we have identified a significant coordination opportunity between:

**KMB Route 272A**: University MTR Station ↔ Pak Shek Kok (白石角)
**Citybus Route 582**: Pak Shek Kok (白石角) ↔ Sai Sha and Shap Sze Heung

### Key Findings:
- **Service Overlap**: Both routes serve the same corridor between University MTR Station and Pak Shek Kok
- **Passenger Demand**: Strong demand for services connecting University MTR Station to Pak Shek Kok area
- **Current Situation**: Two separate operators providing similar services on the same route
- **Coordination Opportunity**: Potential for schedule optimization to provide more even spacing between services

### Coordination Potential:
Given the strong demand for University MTR Station to Pak Shek Kok services, there appears to be an opportunity to adjust the schedules of both routes to provide more even spacing between services. This could:

- **Reduce waiting times** for passengers at University MTR Station
- **Improve service frequency** through coordinated scheduling
- **Optimize resource utilization** by reducing service gaps
- **Enhance passenger experience** with more predictable service intervals

Our analysis has identified similar coordination opportunities across Hong Kong's bus network, where multiple operators serve overlapping routes with potential for schedule optimization.

## Key Questions

1. **Is the Transport Department aware of coordination opportunities between routes serving the same corridors, particularly the KMB 272A and Citybus 582 services between University MTR Station and Pak Shek Kok?**

2. **What general principles does the Transport Department follow when considering existing routes during new route approvals, especially regarding overlapping services?**

3. **How does the Transport Department evaluate the potential for schedule coordination between different operators serving similar routes?**

4. **What processes or systems does the Transport Department use to identify opportunities for service coordination and schedule optimization?**

5. **Are there any ongoing initiatives or plans to improve coordination between different operators on overlapping routes, particularly regarding schedule optimization?**

If available, we would also appreciate any data or references (e.g., coordination frameworks, scheduling optimization principles, or coordination opportunity assessments) relevant to the Transport Department's awareness and consideration of coordination opportunities, particularly regarding overlapping services and schedule optimization.

Thank you for your attention. We look forward to your response and would be happy to provide further details if helpful.

Yours faithfully,
