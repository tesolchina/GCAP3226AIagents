# Team 2: Bus Route Coordination

## Project Overview
Optimization of public transportation routes and coordination in Hong Kong using mathematical models and simulation, focusing on overlapping routes (KMB 272A and Citybus 582).

**Supervisors:** Dr. Talia Wu (Mathematics), Dr. Simon Wang (English)
**Final Deliverable:** 2,500-3,000 word group research report
**Current Status:** Week 5 - Project Scoping & Planning

## Core Research Question
**Primary Question:** To what extent does the Hong Kong Transport Department use data-driven approaches in bus route coordination and frequency optimization?

**Specific Focus Areas:**
- Bus frequency optimization and passenger demand prediction
- Route coordination strategies to minimize wait times
- Impact of external factors (weather, events) on ridership
- Optimal balance between service frequency and operational costs

## Project Structure

### Government Communication
- `Transport_Department_Email_Draft.md` - Email to Transport Department for data access
- `Bus_Operators_Email_Draft.md` - Email to KMB and Citybus for operational data
- `emailDraft01.md` - Original email drafts (for reference)

### Project Planning and Coordination
- `Project_Roadmap_Team2.md` - Detailed project timeline and milestones
- `Project_Report_Outline.md` - Iterative report structure and writing assignments
- `Teacher_Update_Notes.md` - Teacher coordination and progress tracking
- `Meeting_Notes_Template.md` - Standardized meeting documentation

### Technical Materials
- `GCAP3226-Topic1-BusFrequency.md` - Bus frequency analysis
- `Topic3_BusRoutesCoordination_MathModels.md` - Comprehensive mathematical modeling approach
- `APIdata/` - API data collection framework and technical implementation
- `README.md` - This file (project overview and coordination)

## Key Research Questions
- How can regression analysis improve demand prediction?
- What coordination strategies minimize passenger wait times?
- How do external factors (weather, events) affect ridership?
- What is the optimal balance between service frequency and cost?
- How can data-driven approaches improve bus route coordination?

## Data Sources and Collection Strategy

### Primary Data Sources
- **Transport Department:** Route approval criteria and coordination policies
- **Bus Operators (KMB & Citybus):** Operational data and coordination practices
- **Field Observations:** Passenger behavior and service patterns
- **Government Reports:** Annual transportation reports and policy documents

### Secondary Data Sources
- **Academic Literature:** Transportation optimization research
- **International Case Studies:** Best practices from other cities
- **Government Publications:** Policy documents and guidelines
- **Media Coverage:** Public discourse on transportation issues

## Methodology

### Regression Analysis
- **Objective:** Predict passenger demand and optimize bus frequency
- **Variables:** Time, weather, events, demographics, route characteristics
- **Output:** Evidence-based recommendations for frequency optimization

### Simulation Model
- **Objective:** Model bus route coordination and passenger flow optimization
- **Components:** Passenger arrival patterns, bus capacity, route overlap, coordination algorithms
- **Scenarios:** Different coordination strategies, frequency adjustments, route optimization

## Technical Framework
Based on existing Route 56 simulation:
- Poisson distribution for passenger arrivals
- Binomial distribution for alighting behavior
- Real-time tracking and queue management
- Performance metrics (wait time, utilization, reliability)
