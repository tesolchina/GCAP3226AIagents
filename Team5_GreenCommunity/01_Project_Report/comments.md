# Team 5 Green Community Project - Comments and Focus Areas

## Specific Government Decisions to Assess

### 1. **Facility Placement Decisions**
- **Strategic Alignment Analysis**: Whether Green@Community facility placement aligns with population density across Hong Kong's 18 administrative districts
- **Data-Driven Placement**: Assessment of methodologies used (population-to-facility ratios, GIS-based planning) for facility location decisions from 2020-present
- **Geographic Distribution**: Analysis of facility distribution patterns and their relationship to community needs

### 2. **Resource Allocation Decisions**
- **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**: Evaluation of HK$270 million operating costs vs. 20,300 tonnes collected (HK$13,300 per tonne)
- **Budget Justification**: Assessment of whether current spending represents optimal resource allocation
- **Performance Metrics**: Analysis of 5.2 million visitors vs. 1.06% of Hong Kong's total recyclables collected

### 3. **App-Based Engagement Decisions**
- **GREEN$ ePIS Mobile App Analysis**: 
  - Monthly active users and user engagement patterns
  - Average points balance and redemption behaviors
  - Geographic breakdown of app usage by district
  - Demographic analysis of user participation

### 4. **Data Utilization in Decision-Making**
- **GREEN$ App Data Analysis**: Whether EPD conducts analyses of mobile app data to examine recycling participation differences across demographic groups
- **Stratified Promotion Strategies**: Assessment of whether insights from app data inform targeted promotion strategies
- **Evidence-Based Policy**: Evaluation of how data drives program design and resource allocation decisions

## Key Data Points for Analysis

### **App Performance Metrics**
- Monthly active users
- Average points balance per user
- Geographic distribution of users by district
- User engagement patterns and redemption behaviors
- Demographic breakdown of participants

### **Facility Performance Data**
- Visitor volume analysis (5.2 million visitors in 2022)
- Recycling volume by facility type and location
- Geographic utilization patterns
- Cost per tonne analysis (HK$13,300 per tonne)

### **Government Decision-Making Transparency**
- Data sources used for facility placement decisions
- Methodology for resource allocation
- Criteria for program evaluation and improvement
- Public access to decision-making processes

## Research Questions for v2 Outline

1. **How does EPD use data to make facility placement decisions, and are these decisions strategically aligned with population density?**
2. **What role does GREEN$ app data play in EPD's decision-making processes for program optimization?**
3. **How cost-effective is the current Green@Community program, and what factors influence resource allocation decisions?**
4. **To what extent does EPD use demographic and behavioral data to develop targeted promotion strategies?**

## Expected Government Responses Integration

Based on the earlier enquiry and letter analysis:
- **Cost-Effectiveness Concerns**: Integration of HK$13,300 per tonne cost analysis
- **Transparency Issues**: Assessment of public access to decision-making processes
- **Data Governance**: Evaluation of how EPD collects, analyzes, and uses data for decisions
- **Accountability Measures**: Analysis of government responsiveness to cost-effectiveness concerns
