similar to team 1, 2 and 3

we need to develop a new outline for the project report

the report should focus on a set of decisions made by the government 
given that the team has sent a request of info /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/GCAP3226/Team5_GreenCommunity/02_Data_Collection/Gov enquiries/email2EPD.md

we need to consider how to incorporate expected replies (info) into the report

create a new md file for outline v1
