Dear Access to Information Officer of the Environmental Protection Department,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am an undergraduate at Hong Kong Baptist University taking a course GCAP3226: Empowering Citizens through Data. Our group project, “Green@Community Recycling Network Analysis,” evaluates the cost-effectiveness of Green@Community and aims to inform resource allocation.

To support our analysis, we request **statistical summaries** or datasets** for the **same most recent 3 full **calendar **years (e.g., “ **1 Jan 2022 to 31 Dec 2024** ” ). If data for 3 years is unavailable, just the latest 1 or 2 years would be appreciated. If that period is unavailable, the closest available period or partial datasets/statistical summaries (e.g., different ranges, quarterly/monthly series, or earlier years) would be appreciated.

Purpose and Use

* Data will be used only for this course project; findings shared in class, a final report, and a briefing to a current Legislative Council member. We will acknowledge EPD and follow any conditions.

**Data we would like to request are as follows:**

1. GREENS mobile app (GREEN$ ePIS)

* User Base:
  * Total number of registered GREEN$ ePIS users
  * Monthly and annual active users in the period (e.g., active users are those who earned GREEN$ through recycling at least once within the period)
* User Demographics (aggregate/anonymized; counts OR percentages OR dataset without PII):
  * Registered user demographics by segments AND; monthly AND annual active user demographics by segments
    * by age OR age group
    * by gender
    * by residential district
    * by residential building type
    * by occupation
* Participation Intensity (aggregate/anonymized; counts OR percentages OR dataset without PII):
  * Annual AND monthly total GREEN$ gained by all users
  * Annual AND monthly GREEN$ gained per active user by segments
    * by age OR age group
    * by gender
    * by residential district
    * by residential building type
    * by occupation
* Activity Metrics (aggregate/anonymized; counts OR percentages OR dataset without PII):
  * Annual AND monthly total GREEN$-earning transaction count
  * Annual AND monthly GREEN$-earning transaction count per active user by segment

2. Green@Community Recycling Facility Visitor Volume and Recycling Volume

* Visitor Volume:
  * Annual AND monthly visitor counts for Green@Community facilities (recycling station, stores, and spots)
  * Annual AND monthly visitor counts by facility type (recycling station/stores/spots)
  * Annual AND monthly visitor counts by each facility
* Contribution to Hong Kong’s Overall Recycling:
  * Annual total municipal solid waste generated in HK
  * Annual total recyclables collected in HK
  * Annual proportion of recyclables handled by Green@Community facilities relative to HK’s total recyclables overall
* Recycling Volume:
  * Annual total recycled weight by Green@Community
  * Annual recycled weight by facility type (recycling station/stores/spots)
  * Annual recycled weight by each facility
* Geographic Utilization:
  * Annual AND monthly recycled weight
    * by district
    * by facility type (recycling station/stores/spots)
    * by each facility

4. Green@Community Operations and Operating Costs

* Operating Costs:
  * Annual total operating cost
  * Any available breakdowns of the operating costs (e.g., staffing, rent, utilities, logistics, maintenance, processing fees, etc.) (if detailed price breakdowns are not available, aggregate breakdowns with just naming what kind of costs are included in it will be appreciated)
* Scale / Inputs:
  * Number of facilities by residential district
  * Number of facilities by facility type
  * Floor area of recycling stores in total OR of each store
  * Staffing counts in total AND by function AND by employment type
  * Unit-cost indicators (e.g., operating cost per recycled weight in terms of tonne)

Format and Documentation:

* Preferred: CSV/Excel/Open API (PDFs acceptable).
* Including brief definitions/notes would be good (e.g., material categories, fiscal vs. calendar year).
* Partial aggregates or public references are welcome if full data are not available.

Please let us know if there are application forms, non-disclosure requirements, or a designated data request channel we should follow.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Yours faithfully,
