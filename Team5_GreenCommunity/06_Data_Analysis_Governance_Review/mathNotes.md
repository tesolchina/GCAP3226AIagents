# Mathematical Models for Green Community Analysis

## Regression Analysis
- **Linear Regression**: Predict community engagement levels using demographic and environmental variables
- **Logistic Regression**: Model participation in green initiatives (yes/no) based on community characteristics
- **Multiple Regression**: Analyze factors affecting green behavior adoption (awareness, incentives, social norms)
- **Time Series Regression**: Track green initiative participation trends over time
- **Spatial Regression**: Model green community development by geographic location and urban planning factors

## Simulation Models
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Model community engagement variability and green initiative success rates
- **Agent-Based Simulation**: Simulate individual and community decision-making for green behavior adoption
- **Social Network Simulation**: Model information diffusion and peer influence in green community initiatives
- **Environmental Impact Simulation**: Model cumulative effects of community green actions on environmental outcomes
- **Policy Effectiveness Simulation**: Test different intervention strategies (incentives, education, infrastructure) for green community development

## Data Requirements
- **For Regression**: Community demographic data, green initiative participation records, environmental indicators, social capital metrics
- **For Simulation**: Individual behavior data, social network connections, environmental baseline data, policy intervention records
