### 2.2 Regression Models for Analysis

#### 2.2.1 Linear Regression Models

```
Recycling_Volume = β₀ + β₁(Age) + β₂(Income) + β₃(Education) + β₄(Distance_to_Facility) + β₅(App_Usage_Frequency) + ε
```

**Model 2: Points Accumulation Analysis**
```
Points_Balance = β₀ + β₁(Recycling_Frequency) + β₂(User_Tenure) + β₃(Demographic_Score) + β₄(Geographic_Factor) + ε
```

**Model 3: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**
```
Cost_per_User = β₀ + β₁(Recycling_Volume) + β₂(Points_Redemption) + β₃(User_Engagement) + β₄(Facility_Utilization) + ε
```

#### 2.2.2 Logistic Regression Models

**Model 4: Participation Prediction**
```
P(Participation) = 1/(1 + e^(-(β₀ + β₁(Demographics) + β₂(Incentives) + β₃(Convenience))))
```

**Model 5: Points Redemption Behavior**
```
P(Redemption) = 1/(1 + e^(-(β₀ + β₁(Points_Balance) + β₂(User_Profile) + β₃(Time_Factor))))
```

#### 2.2.3 Multiple Regression Models

**Model 6: Comprehensive User Behavior**
```
User_Engagement_Score = β₀ + β₁(Demographics) + β₂(Behavioral_Factors) + β₃(Environmental_Factors) + β₄(Social_Factors) + ε
```

**Model 7: Geographic Optimization**
```
Facility_Effectiveness = β₀ + β₁(Population_Density) + β₂(User_Concentration) + β₃(Transportation_Access) + β₄(Competing_Facilities) + ε
```
