# Week 4 Lecture Transcript Formatting

**Simon Wang:** Alright, so, we are in week 4 now for our course, and, before we get started, I just want to invite all the students to, log in with your HKBU credentials, so you will be able to have access to this page. And not every student will have access to this page. By default, I think only the students from science faculty, will have access to the API key. But I submitted your name to ITO, so you should be able to access this page as well.

## Introduction to API

So very briefly, I want to explain what is API. API stands for Application Programming Interface. Which is a different way to communicate with the computer system. The more conventional, typical way of Communicate with the computer system is through what we call graphical user interface. Like what you can see now. So, you see there's some graphics, and you enter, you type some text. And you will be able to communicate, and the chatbot will respond in a graphical user interface.

But the application programming interface is, a different interface in the sense that, we do not use this kind of, GUI, or graphical user interface, instead of we write codes. And, through the codes, and we, following the protocols and rules specified in the API, so that Our computer program can communicate with a computer system, like large language model.

Now, the reason we need you to grab this key is because later on, you need to enter the key into a platform that we built. And this way, our platform will be able to leverage the ITO's platform, and Because, you know, tokens are not free. You know, that's the basic fact. The fact that whenever you talk to a large language model, somebody has to run the computer somewhere to process your response and to run the model. So, tokens are not free, and ITO actually bought a lot of tokens from Microsoft Azure, and therefore, each of us can access the HKBU General AI services.

When you got the API key, and you enter to our system. you will be able to use the token from HKB UITO allocated to you. And, and then you can enjoy the services, okay? So I hope that's… clear enough instructions or explanation. If it doesn't make sense to you, that's okay, because you don't have to understand everything in order to use it, right?

So all you have to do is just come to this page and generate the API key, and remember, once you generate the key, you have to keep it somewhere, okay? Because it will show once only. And I'm not going to generate my key again, because I already generated before. So, go ahead and do that, and keep it in a place that's safe, okay? So, any, any question? So take some time and, get your key. I think I need to find mine as well. Now, Okay, I think, we should officially get started. We've got 27 students here, which is great.

## Typhoon Letters and Experiential Learning

Well, again, I just want to very briefly talk about… because today, the reason why we are, we are having this, online meeting is because Typhoon, so I want to very quickly, share with you two letters that I… I published a while ago. about Typhoon, so… because, in this course, we're trying to… look at the government's decision and how data is being used to inform the government decisions, and we don't just do things within the classroom. This is an experiential learning course, so we actually want students to experience something different, something that you don't typically get in a university classroom.

So… One thing that I hope some of you can experience is actually if you write letters to South China Morning Post, because this way you will be able to voice your opinions, you're going to join a conversation about public policy.

### Letter on Typhoon Response (Menkok 2018)

So here's one example. If you still remember, I don't know whether you remember, this was a letter published back… In 2018, when there's this typhoon called, Menkok. So, rumor says that, you know, the coming typhoon is as strong, or even stronger than this one. But look at what happened, the day after typhoon. You know, people get stuck in this, in this, MTR station in Taiwai. And, I was… I was writing, you know, I wrote this letter to argue that actually, we should consider Allowing people to take a break after the typhoon. In case, you know, the city, you know, needs some time to recover. So, so that's, that's one, one… letter I want to share with you. And I think it's important to take a data-driven approach to this kind of decision-making. I don't know whether the Security Bureau or the Office of Chief Executive has been reviewing this case. I hope they have learned a lesson, because in terms of data-driven approach, we should definitely look at the whole, you know, transportation network, the infrastructure, to what extent there's damages to the system that the city needs time to recover. Right? So, so that's… that's a very important, case we want to, we want to consider. In fact, we have one team who's going to work on Typhoon, this semester, so I hope that team can also take a look at, this, this issue.

### Letter on Stock Market Operations During Typhoons (2024)

Now, another letter I want to share with you, it was published in, last year, actually, 2024, Because starting from last year. the Hong Kong stock market will actually operate as usual, even when there's a typhoon. So, this, this is a new, new arrangement, starting from last year, and the argument I was trying to make is that as the title suggests, if the Hong Kong stock is changed. Could operate as usual, you know, because people work from home and, etc. then everybody should be doing that. Knowledge workers, schools, universities, we should all just, work as usual, you know, even during the typhoon days. But, unfortunately, at this stage, the Education Bureau the universities do not really have any official policies over how work should be arranged during the typhoon days. So again, if we think about data-driven approach, if we think about how we can help the government to make better decisions, then we need to start thinking about how to collect the data, how to use the data to, inform the decisions, alright? So, you know, because of today's timing, I just want to kind of share with, two, essays that, I published it a while ago.

## Project Team Updates and Google Drive Structure

And another quick update is I've created Google Drive folders for each team, because I think right now we've got six teams. Each team has already selected a specific topic, so we're kind of ready to move on, to start actually working on the projects. So, anyone who is not yet in a team. or anyone who cannot access to the Google Drive folder that I share through the small WhatsApp group. please let me know. You can send a message to the small WhatsApp group, you need to give me your Gmail account. In fact, your classmates, your groupmates who have access to the Google folder, Google Drive folder, they should be able to invite you to access the Google folder.

Alright? So, within the Google Drive folder, you will be able to see a couple of Google Docs. Okay, so all these Google Docs are empty at this stage, but just to kind of quickly go through this…

### Contents of the Google Drive Folder

We will have a meeting notes page. Basically, whenever we meet, whenever we have any progress on the project, you need to update the meeting notes, and you probably want to meet with your teammates from time to time to, you know, start working on the project, then you should update the meeting notes.

We have a data collection plan, because, Next week, we're going to have small group meetings, and the week after is actually public holiday. So you should take the time to… the whole week, to doing some data collection. So, that page, that doc, is for you to update records about data collection.

And there's also a worksheet, this is just a spreadsheet for you to, in case you want to have, put some structured data in that sheet, you can do that.

We have a project report. document, that's where you can actually start planning your project report. This, this document, I think I'm going to rename it because, you know, on a second thought, I think this document should be more about outreach and presentation, so I'm going to rename it later.

So basically, this Google Drive folder is where you want to do some real work, and you want to move forward.

### Documenting Contributions

And just one quick reminder about doing everything is you want to document your contribution, okay? So whenever you're updating the document, whenever you are making some efforts to move the project forward, write down everything you have done with your name on it. Okay? Because at some point, we will start reviewing, everybody's work, we want to make sure that everybody contributes fairly to the teamwork, because part of the… I think about 50% of the whole course grades is by groups. But, we definitely want, you know, students to. contribute, and we enjoy teamwork, and we work together. So, it's very important to keep record of everything you do. In, in this space.

Alright, and both Taylor and I, we have access to this space as well, and feel free to raise any questions, you can add the questions here, and then you can, you know, send us the link through the WhatsApp group or email us, and basically, this is going to be the platform where we're going to do the collaboration work. Okay, so any, any questions, any concerns, just, let us know.

## Example Website and Transition to Simulation

And this is actually a website I built a bit earlier, you can check out. It's kind of fun, because we use them API to access the data from Hong Kong Observatory, and we update this in real time, so we'll be able to see dumb, the wind data from the 30 stations And to see whether… to what extent the real, wing strings actually align with the signal number that the observatory published. But I won't get into details, because that's… basically the project of one of the teams. But just for fun, because you can see that the storm is coming, and we should be able to look at the data in real time. Right.

Now… Before I invite, Taliet, you know, for Dr. Wu to talk about simulation, which is the main focus of today's topic, today's work discussion, because last week we talked about regression, this week we talked about simulation, there's a little bit more, in-class exercise we're going to work on.

## Reflective Essay Assignment

I want to talk about reflective essay. Now, a reflective essay is one of the assessment components. It actually accounts for 20% of the final grades. There's a total of 3 reflective essays you need to write, and this essay is not very long, it's only about 200 words. And one of the, kind of, the special features of this course is that you can use AI to write an essay. So we have some AI chatbot. that can help you, which is the reason why we invite you to set up the API key from the ITO page, right?

So, if you come to this Moodle page. you will be able to see there's the reflective essay assignment. The deadline is, about two weeks from now, okay? So, there's a little bit of time you can work on, so just take your time, and you don't have to submit it just yet, so any question you may have, just let us know. The way you submit this essay is just to reply, okay? So you reply here. And you can submit your… Your essay.

Now, actually, you can read through this Moodle, so a Moodle page, so I'm not going to get into everything, but just one thing to highlight is that we have this Page. This is where you can actually, talk to an AI, okay? So we have this AI writing assistance, as you can see. You need to reflect on what you have learned in the past 4 weeks or so, and also you want to start thinking about the project, alright? Because in the past 2 weeks, well, including this week, The main task we're trying to teach you, well, especially Italia, is trying to teach you some tools, okay, for quantitative reasoning. We talked about regression, last week talked about… we're going to talk about simulation. And once you learn a little bit about these tools, you need to think about how these tools will be applied to your projects. And while you're doing that, you can start writing this refractive essay, okay?

### Using the AI Writing Assistance Platform

So… As you can see here, there's a little bit of information, and you can go back to the Moodle page. But then… how do you use the tutor? Well, basically, you need to get your key. And then you click here, That will give you… get you to the… the tutor page. This is iframe, so it takes a while to load. And, here is where you want to enter the key. Okay, let me see if I got my key. So you got your key. And you choose your model, usually 4.1 would be good, and then you click connect.

Now, once you click connect, you get connected. Right, and then there's some system prompt here. There's a welcome prompt here, it says, You know, This is your tutor for the course, you need to write a short, refractive essay and everything. And said, type OK to get started, then you type OK. Okay, and then the tutorial will start talking to you.

Great, let's get started. Thinking about your team project, where were your… the key decisions made by the government that your team plans to focus on? Remember, we have this post that we talked about a while ago, we talk about, like. the group project instruction and timeline, I think we talked about this in week 2 or something. So, last week and this week, we explored topics, we talked about the tools, and next week, when we do the group consultation, we need to you know, finalize the top… I think everybody already selected topic, but then we have to start working on it. So go through this page, And then you come back. And you can start talking, so something like, maybe you can just, use an example. whether… to… Hello, people. To take a day off after. Typhoon. So just, just, just as an example, okay? And, and, you have a conversation with, with the chatbot. and go, and so on and so forth, and then your teams look at this, think about the data, right? How did the government use the data to inform the decision, blah blah blah. And you can say what… You can say something like, what would you suggest? And also you can close this if you want a bit more space. Okay, and then you can, you can start, ask the chatbot about… the model and everything, okay?

But just to remember, AI can hallucinate. You know, AI is not 100% reliable. So part of the skills you need to learn in this course when you interact with AI is to be critical. Okay, don't just take anything that AI says as correct, or as completely reliable, alright? So you keep going like this for a little while. And then you click this green button. Well, actually, at some point. You know, the chapel will start… guide you to write an essay. But if you say, can you write… the essay. Well, actually, when you say, can you write an essay for me? The chat will probably help you to write an essay. But remember, you still have to put a lot of thoughts into it, okay? Because, because what we're trying to do in this course is… Okay, so actually, they write an essay for you, you see what I mean? But that's not… clearly not what you want to do to just submit it to the Moodle, right? So you actually have to put more thoughts and everything.

But again, when you click here. You got… You got a, a page. Where you can, get a chat history and a little bit of analysis of what you have done. And, you, you can put your ad… you can put your email here, because… We don't have a login system. once you close the browser, everything is gone, okay? So, before you close your browser, make sure that you… you click the green button here, green check, and then you email. Alright, so, so you will get an email copy. Of the chat history. And your teacher will also get an email copy of the report. And if you want to download. You can also download the Markdown or PDF. Okay.

So that's the… that's the platform we built to help you, okay? So I hope you will enjoy it, I hope it's a good experience for you, because we believe that AI is going to be the partner for all of us, you know, especially when you become a knowledge worker after you graduate. So we want to create an authentic learning experience for you, that's why we have this AI platform for you to try, and… And just a kind of disclaimer, the platform is relatively new, and there could be some glitches, some, you know, bugs and everything, so please be patient, and do let us know how it goes, and try to keep a record of everything you do, just in case you, you know, close the browser or something, or the copy may not… the email function may not work properly, then download the Markdown, or download the… the, PDF before you hit the send button and before you close the browser.

Alright, so I think that's all I have to say. Any questions? Remember, in the Moodle forum, we actually have one post for each topic. I think the information here is still useful. You do want to come back to kind of learn more about how this, project, you know, how you should pursue this project. And we have the smaller WhatsApp group for each team. we should work very closely, through the WhatsApp group, and, you know, you guys may want to, you know, set some meetings, and, because, you know. I think the goal is for us to… Send off inquiries to, to the government, around, next week. So you need to start thinking about that as well. And we're going to have another chatbot to help you with that, but for now, this chatbot for writing reflective journal, a reflective essay, should be a good start, because you only take the opportunity to reflect on what you have learned, and also to think about how you move forward, with the other… with the projects. Okay? So, any, any question? I think a good place to start is actually… this Moodle page. Because… I think this is the page where… You should have everything.

I saw some message on the chat. Oh. Oh, okay, so I think I need to update the Moodle page about the deadline, because we kind of extend the deadline a little bit, so, Yeah. So, one question about the Moodle page, I think I need to update that. I think the deadline should be October 5th.

What should invite accounts says it's not eligible to use the API service. I think you have to log out and log in again. Because the… ITO colleagues told me that they have already updated the records, so all the names that I submitted should have access to the API service. If you cannot, you log out, and then log in again. If you still cannot access the page, just email me, and I will follow up, because I'm sure that I submitted everybody's name. Any other… Questions?

Okay, so… I think, that's all I have to say. I'm going to pass the floor to Talia to talk about simulation.

**Tian WU:** Okay, so good morning, everyone. Can you hear me clearly?

**Simon Wang:** Yeah, okay.

**Tian WU:** Okay, so, can you see my screen of the Moodle page? We're seeing…

**Simon Wang:** VS Code.

**Tian WU:** Let me share my screen again. So now should be the Moodle page, right?

**Simon Wang:** Yes.

**Tian WU:** Yeah, okay, so before I started the, explanation, I would like to remind you that I updated the, Jupyter Notebook for the regression part. And I also uploaded a new joker notebook, which is called the Box Whisker Plot. And also, we have the simulation notebook for today's demonstration. So these are the three documents you may download. So later, we will discuss them one by one.

## Follow-up on Data Visualization (Regression Exercise)

And before I start, talking about the simulation, I would like to follow up on the last in-class exercise, which is about some data visualization you worked on. Let me share… Okay, so now my shared screen should be the, VS Code. Page Right. So last time, at the end of the in-class exercise, I invited you to do two visualization tests to explore the relationship of, That might be interesting.

So recall that the data set we used is the municipal solid waste dataset. Where our response variable is the level of support for this policy. And the potential explanatory variables, including the demographic variables, attitude-related variables, and behavior-related variables. And when I received the in-class exercise. This is the typical visualization result I get. So you can see for the first visualization, it is about the support level versus the perceived fairness of the policy. But what you would observe are these, separated dots. It is because, for fairness and the support level, they're both categorical variables. they can only take values like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There's very limited and discrete integers. Okay. So all the possible combinations are shown by these dots. But this is not that informative, given that these two variables, they are categorical.

So I think a better way to do it is… Then open. The latest regression… notebook. So here, it's actually used the bar chart. To show, in different categories of perceived fairness. What are the percentages of opposed, neutral, and support? So to do this, we can first record the, strongly against and against as opposed. And we code very strongly support and support as support, so we will overall have these three groups. And then… Show the percentages of these three groups. In different categories of this perceived fairness. So if we… show… Again, the two variables in this way, we can easily observe the trend. With the increase of the perceived fairness of this policy, The percentages of a post decrease. Right? The blue bars, the height, decreased. Whereas for the height of the green bars. The percentages of support is increasing from, like, 11% to 75%. So the message is that if the variables themselves are categorical. Then, it is better to use bar charts. And using percentages. To represent for different categories. The percentages of different, groups. For… for the other categorical variable. I think for this, figure, it is… More informative compared to these dots. Right, hopefully you, agree with me. So when we do the visualization, we need to consider the type of data.

So then, when we use this scatter plot. Well, when the variables are continuous, it is more often to use the scatterplot to show the relationship between the two variables. So I think in the demo. We once used the, scatter plot to Let me find it. So now I'm at this regression model's full notebook. Yeah, here. So this is not a good example, but at least the, one of the variables the distance between home and the nearest facilities. This is a continuous variable. And for this scatter plot, we can see whether, on average, with the increase of the distance between the home of the participant of the survey to the nearest Recycling facility, whether their support level is increasing or decreasing. So most of the time, we use Scatterflow to measure or to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. This is the first message.

And the second is about the, plot. Showing the education level versus the level of support. So again, education level is a categorical variable. Right, it can only take these discrete values, 1, 2, 3, 4, and we know the larger the value, it represents the, respondents has, a higher education, higher level of education. So again, if these two are both categorical, a more appropriate way to visualize the relationship should be, again, the bar plot, showing the percentages. In each, there's different, level of education, the, percentages of the, against, neutral, and support.

### Understanding Box and Whisker Plots

And here, this plot is actually a box whisker plot. And this is usually used to show the distribution. Of a continuous variable. So I will give, a numerical example to… To show you what does this box mean, and what this whiskers mean. So now let's move to the box whisker plot. I mentioned this notebook in the Moodle. So suppose I have this sequence of values, So I generated these values. In total, there are 26. And they are, capped as two decimal places. And it is already sorted. So the smallest is from 0.15, and the largest is from 4.85.

To generate the box whisker plot. We need to calculate the so-called five-point summary statistics for these data points. Specifically, when you find the minimum value, which is obviously 0.15, And also the maximum value, which is 4.85, right? And for the middle 3-1, They are median. So the median basically means the data points were cut the whole data set into two parts. So the first 50% of the data, their value will be smaller than the median. And the remaining around 50% of the data, their value, will be greater than the median value.

So, in our dataset, Given that there are 26 values. So there will be two values sitting in the middle. Which is the, 13th 13th data, and the 14th data. For each role, there are 5 data points. So, the 13th data point is here, and the 14th data point is here. And the median will be the average value of the two data points. So we take average of these two, and it is 0.8. So here, originally, the data points are not exactly two decimal places. So after some rounding, we have this 0.79 and 0.8. And after we take average, and again, doing the rounding, the median is 0.8. So this means that if we have a Like, you imagine that if there is a, little vertical bar here. This is the first 50% of the data. Given that This data is already sorted from the smallest to the largest. Whereas the remaining ones are the later.
