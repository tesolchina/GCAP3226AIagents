**Simon Wang:** Take a lot of time and effort and try to make it work. And then one of the final crucial steps is to make sure that students will you know, take this course and will be on board. So that's very challenging, which is why I think, we're very… happy and grateful that you are here, even though right now we only got 5 students, but I hope more students will join, and also we're recording this, so the first two weeks, you know, if students join later, they can refer to the video. You know, this course is very unique. In the sense that this is a course co-hosted by Mass Department and, language center. So, when you think about, transdisciplinary, you know, cross-disciplinary collaboration, when the math teacher working with a language teacher, it's, not a very common combination. You know, I taught a GCAP course before, I'm still teaching the other GCAP course. it was, me with a professor from the English department, so that actually makes more sense, right? So, Ben and I were both from the language background, but this time, me and Talia, we're from very different background. And, but I think these kinds of collaboration is very important, because in the real world. You know, when you try to solve some real-world problem, you can't just rely on one set of tools. Right? Of course, quantitative reasoning is so important these days, right? We're living in the age of big data. We are, you know, embracing AI, and AI is driven by big data. So, quantitative listening technologies are very important, but then at the same time, we also need, humanities, we need people who can think more qualitatively, people who can write very well. So, I think that's where I come to this course, you know. I want to work with my colleague Talia, with a strong quantitative reasoning background. You know, she has a PhD in math and doing a lot of work on applying statistical models to public health. But then I also want to leverage my expertise on working with the government in the past almost 10 years. When I say I work with the government, I'm not really kind of working with them as colleagues. You will see in a minute what do I mean by working with the government. Basically, we are… taking the sort of a citizen's role, okay? So we approach the government staff, and we try to ask questions, understand their practices in the public policy. And then we critically review their work. So that's what I mean by working with the government. So that's kind of the background here. So what we're trying to do is to… Seek some kind of synergy between a maths teacher and a language teacher. Alright, so, that's kind of the premise of… of our course. And, I'd like to invite you to come to this page. Let's see how you can come to this page. Probably the best way to go is to go to Moodle, and in fact. you should get my email, you know, in the calendar, in the Google Cali… you know, in the calendar, there's also a link. But either way. If you go to Moodle, You will find a, google Docs. Okay, so, so it's kind of, Yeah, so… so if you go to Moodle, you will find the Google Docs link. So we're going to update this Moodle from time to time throughout the semester, but, the best way to access all the materials is actually come to this page. This is a kind of an unremarkable page here. We're trying to figure things out, you know, basically this is a new course. This is a great opportunity for us to explore and try different things. So, and we're very happy that we got a… a pretty small class size so far. You know, we actually have 16 students enrolled, but Hopefully more students will join us soon. At any rate, so if you come to this page, you will see the first link here, which is the course hub. Alright, so this is where, I'd like to kind of just give you a little bit more background and what we're trying to do here. So the course title is Empowering Citizens Through Data, Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong. I think every single word here actually is quite important. So the fundamental motivation here is to empower citizen, all right? Because even though the word citizen implies that we are the taxpayers, we have certain political rights, we are not always feel empowered, right? Because these days, the elite, the government people, you know, the top government officials, they just do whatever they want to do. So we're trying to empower people. But how do we do that? Well, we do it through data science, okay? That's why we have a mathematician here. Okay, so to be more specific, we try to participate in the policy analysis. So we analyze policy not just to do research or to write papers, that's usually… that's the normal, you know, the conventional way of doing things in the university is to do research and then publish papers. Get more money, you know? But what we are trying to do here is to, engage with the government staff in a more, kind of, close way, and in a more confrontational way, so that we can better understand the current practice of the government, but then try to offer recommendations. try to critically review what the government is trying to do. In the context of Data analysis, okay? So, in terms of course objective, you can see that we are trying to offer a set of analytical tools To enable the so-called data-informed policy-making. Now, data-informed policymaking should be quite straightforward, right? The idea that we want to collect the data, and we want to use data To inform and to make better decisions on public policy. That, that shouldn't be, be, you know, surprising at all. But the difficulty here is that to what extent… the question here is, to what extent the Hong Kong government staff are doing that. Right? So, to what extent Do the Hong Kong government staff actually make decisions based on data? That's the very first question we have to think about. We have to keep in mind. So I think this is a good opportunity for you to invite some of you to talk. I have one student sitting over there, so maybe… what's your name? And, what do you think about my question? My name is Eric. Do you answer my question? Okay. So, my question, again, if you don't know my question, do you know my question? Do you know my question? No? Okay. My question is, To what extent is the Hong Kong government Making the decisions based on data. Does it make sense? What do you think? Hmm. I think the government, should… look more about, advanced data, like, on the media, or they do research to look around the whole society, to get the advanced data, to implement, advanced policy to enhance the… Efficiency of the entire society. Okay, so… you are saying that the government should Use more data to make decisions, right? Okay, I agree with you. I'm sure that most of you agree, right? The government should. But my question is. More like an empirical question. Everybody… we all agree that the government should. But the question is, to what extent they are doing it now? You see what I mean? Thanks. What do you think I think, the government used mandated. Yeah. But… About the decision, I think the data is not the most important part. So, when you say the government uses a lot of data, where do you get the information? Where do you get the information? Every time we have researched the… people, and Environment data. So you, you did some research? Those organizations, they did that, and… I remember refer to the data they gave them, and sometimes, like, some over-budget something. You only used to make? What's your name? My name is Bonnie, and… we see that some of the construction projects are sometimes over budget, but they still do it, because they think that it's good. But I don't think that it's supported by some data, but some… their vision, and yeah, they do use some data, but sometimes, some vision things are not… cannot be analyzed, because there are some future things, and, just their wish. They would like the Hong Kong to be like that, and… And, yeah, sometimes it's beneficial to us, because… is addressing some problems, currently, like, some people are poor, they are not… they have not… do not have enough money to buy a house. They would use this data to build some, public building and some… something, so, Yeah, they do use it, but they mixed with some that is not about data. Okay, so you refer to the practice of the government, consulting the companies, right? Yeah, they do. Okay. Well… I think we need to move on, but the short answer to my question To what extent the government is using the data to make decisions. The short answer? Is we don't know. Okay? We don't know. Because the government do not tell us. Right? I mean, you can probably look at the newspaper from time to time, there might be some reference to a little bit, like, consulting firms, or there could be some, you know, we do have a… you know, we do have staff, you know, handling data, but to what extent where the government is really using the data to make decisions, we don't know. You see? That's the problem. We don't know. But now, in this course, We are going to find out. Alright? We're gonna find out? Do you know how? You only pass the mic over to this? Good rules, yeah, yeah. Oop! Okay, so here's the second question. Suppose we don't know To what extent the government is using data to make decisions? We need to find out. How are we gonna do that? Just, look at the government's policy to know that Do the government use the data to… using the policy to make, makes Hong Kong be better or not. Go to the government website, right? Are you saying, okay, go to the government website. Go to the legislative council website. So those are the reports you can find, right? Well, of course, that's something we can do. You can go to different departments, you know, legislative council, they all got reports. And in the report, you may be able to see here and there, talking about to what they tend to use data. But now, in this course, we're going to take a different approach, and I think this is a very fresh approach. Okay, unless you took my other GCAP course, you probably don't know this approach. It's called codon Access to Information. Okay? Have you heard of that? Code on access to information? From time to time, you will watch it on the, on the street, or there's… could be on TV. It's called Gonhoi Jiu Xiaoza. Have you heard of it? Alright. So, in English, it's called on access to information. Now, we are going to use this code. and to… ask questions. We're going to send the questions directly to the department, to the specific department in the Hong Kong government, and ask them. The basic question is just the first question I raised. To what extent Does the government. To what extent is your department Using data. to make decisions. All right? That's a very general question, but when you contextualize it, when you adapt this question to a specific problem or policy, it becomes a host of new questions that you have to ask. Alright? And we have to be hurried. Because this semester, you know, every semester we've only got 13 weeks. But do you know how long it would take for the government to reply to us when you send off the… Question. So suppose today? 2nd of September, you sent 3 questions, or 5 questions, to Department of Health. How long do you think they will get back to you? Huh Right, 3 weeks is the standard, kind of, expected time frame, alright? 3 weeks is the calendar week, okay? So, in other words, if you… if you send a request right before the Christmas break, you know, that means they have more work to do. Anyway, 3 weeks is the normal time frame under the Code of Access to Information. But then they can, under so-called exceptional circumstances, they can extend it to another 7 weeks. Okay? So that means… We need to be prepared for that kind of scenario. Alright, so maybe today, you send the questions, 7 weeks later. You will get the results. That's already, like, half of the semester gone, you see what I mean? So one way to… Avoid this kind of a situation is try to break down your inquiry into a smaller number of questions. Okay, because usually you ask a lot of questions, they will say, oh, we need more time to process. But if you treated it like a separate application, then they have to do it. You saw me. I feel like that's a… that's a little trick. Anyway, Let's see, right, so very quickly, let me finish talking about objective. So we are trying to offer some tools for… To, practice the data analytics. And we are trying to figure out There could be a better way for the government to do things. Alright, so after we got the information from the government regarding their practices. We are going to say, look, there's actually a better way to do this. And this is how… this is where Taleo will come in. Because she got the background, she knows how to do math. And we are going to propose a better way to solve this problem. By using data. By using math. Alright? And this is how we're going to build the argument, okay? This is very important. We're going to make this argument. The argument is, This is how the government is currently doing things. Okay, that's what we find out. And then… With the data, we got… And with the mass model and, analytics. We propose that this is the better way to do things. Everybody can benefit. But the government… The government staff have to do things differently. That's our argument. We hope we can make that argument strong. And then we're going to… Send the report to the lawmakers. Alright? Because the lawmakers are supposed to be the gatekeepers, right? So they approve all the funding requests, they're supposed to monitor the performance of the government staff. Alright, so that's, that's a very important part. Tayle, do you want to quickly talk about some mass tools that can make this happen? Okay. Alright? So, I think I pretty much covered the course objective, right? So the key thing is to evaluate the government staff's practices of policy analysis and policy making. And to see to what extent the data is playing a role. Our initial impression is that Only to a limited extent. The government is using the data. So, we have a mission. Alright? So all the students taking this course, We are, as a team. We are on a… on a mission. Our mission, Is to find out To what extent the government is using the data to make decisions, and most likely, the answer would be quite disappointing, and therefore, we are going to do research, we're going to do math model to show people, to make the argument that, actually. The government can do a better job. Okay? So it won't be a happy story for the government. You see what I mean? But It's going to be an important argument for our society. Because the message is clear. If we want better decisions, better policies, we have to adopt The data-driven approach. And this is what this course is about. Alright? Now, in terms of… Well, we have the assessment part, and then if you click on this. We got a role map. So, yeah, I don't want to spend too much time here because, you know, Tally has got other things to cover as well. I have something to cover as well, something more specific. But, this is basically a kind of like a tentative plan, you know, as I said earlier, this is the first time we teach this course. We're trying to set things up and figure things out, so please be patient with us. But, as you can see, we got the course instruction, this week, and then we will start learning some AI tools, and learning some, like, Jupyter notebooks. using Python to… to, learn how to visualize things. And, we will start picking up the topics and form groups in week 3, Because that's the end of the airdrop period, and And we will have good consultation, we will go to the field. you know, we'll try to collect some data. For example, one of the projects we're going to work on is about the bus frequency, right? So, maybe we'll have to go to the bus stop to count how many people, how many passengers, you know, boarded the buses on a particular time source, you know. And, and, and so field work is something we're looking to do. Data request is something we will work on as well. We're going to write to the government. But again, week 5 to 6 could be a little bit late, you know, if you got a 7-week extension, you know. That's already, like, the end of the semester. But again, this is a general, kind of, tentative roadmap, just to give you a sense of what we're trying to do here. In terms of workload. I think, in general, GE course shouldn't be too heavy, right, compared to your, to your major course. So, so I think we are trying to make this course manageable, all right? And there will be a lot of support, during the class, so, you know, everybody will get… the job done. We'll get something, you know, a good outcome out of this course. And, just a quick, kind of survey. How many of you are from math or science background? Raise your hand. 1, 2… Okay, so the rest of you from accounting? ComputerNet, then you have your science, right? Okay, so again, how many of you are from science, including computer science and math? Oh, okay. Well, how about you? Communication. Okay. Well, I think these days, communication, people need to learn computer science as well, right? How about you? Yeah. Right. Right, that's… that's a good question. So, I think the general question here is, this is a course offered by the math department, right? So, how friendly it is to students from, you know, not-so-strong math background? Well… I think the general question… the general answer to this question is that you shouldn't worry too much. Because, number one, this is a course called… taught by Taylor and me, and I'm a language teacher, so, I only had got… I only did high school math, so, you know, a little bit… a little bit calculus in college. But you can consider me as a person from non-math background. And we are going to make sure that this course will be accessible to students with very little math background, okay? And another important aspect is that now we have AI. Okay? We have AI on our side, so, especially for coding, you know, we need to write some programming codes in this course. But most of the coding can actually be done through vibe coding, so to speak, these days. Everybody's talking about vibe coding. So basically, you talk to AI, you know, in natural language. What you want. for a computer program to work, and then the AI will write a program for you, and all you have to do is to copy and paste. It's not… It's not exactly that way, but it's pretty close, right? So it's almost like, even if you don't know much about programming, you can start doing programming. Of course, at the end of the day, you still… you still have to learn a little bit more about the… the programming, right? You can't just say, oh, this is the text, you just… just run the codes, but… But anyway, so, so going back to your question, I don't think you have to worry that much, because… you know, We are here to support you. And, yeah. Now, in terms of the assessment. We have a good project that… Would count 30% of the final grades, so we are expecting Something like 4 to 5 students working as a group. Alright, so, but right now, we'll probably form two groups. We'll see how many students will be here, next Tuesday to decide. So that's 30%. Which, which is… Kind of, like, the… the… The capstone thing, the final project. And there will be, in-class exercises. In week 3 and Week 4, Alright, so that's important. You need to come for some in-class exercise that would take… Account for 10%. The group presentation would be… closely connected to the project. So basically, you… you did your project, you… Write your report, and then you need to present it. All right, so there will be two rounds of presentation. The first round is more like a rehearsal. The second round, we are still, planning this, but we might go to the Legislative Council to To do it. Okay, so let me show you a link. So, this is a Facebook post. So, we had a… meeting with Dr. Wendy Hong last December. Tally was here, was there. So this is my other GE course, right? So we did… A presentation like this. Right? Okay. So hopefully… well, we haven't confirmed it yet, but hopefully, We will be doing something similar. Okay? Alright, so that's… that's the presentation. And then… We have some very short, reflective essay you need to write. Okay? And that would account for 20%, and that's the individual work, because we try to balance the good work with individual work. The good project and presentation would be good work, but then the reflective essay would be, individuals' work. And then there's something, unique. in this course is that we also expect you to write a human-AI collaboration report. Because in this course, we're going to use AI quite extensively. Not just to generate text, but to generate codes. Right? So, I'm sure that you will have a lot of experience of using AI in this course, and unlike some other courses. Where teachers are more cautious. And, try to warn you against not using AI in this way or that way. We are more positive. On the use of AI. Of course, we still uphold The ethical standards and plagiarism is not tolerated in this course, just like any other courses. But, we're going to take a more proactive approach to the using of AI. We want to teach you how to use AI in some new ways. So that's why we actually put Human AI Collaboration Report as one of the assessment components right here. Alright, so… That would make… the, individual and group assessment, exactly 50% versus 50%, okay? I think that's a pretty balanced arrangement, you know. You can work together, get support from your Peers, but then at the same time, you will be able to make your individual efforts to try to do well in these schools. Any questions? About the course so far. You know, the first two weeks, usually, we just, introduce the course, people shop around. Hopefully the course is, sufficiently interesting to you. And, yeah. Taylor, you have something to add? Sure, you do that first, and then I will go back to talk about my week one stuff. Okay. Okay, thank you very much, Simon. Hello everyone, I'm Talia from the MS department. So, previously, Simon just introduced a very big picture of this course, the vision, the overview, of this course. Now, for the following part, I will introduce some down-to-earth part of this course. So, exactly how much of the technology or math will be involved in this course. So you can find the slides on Moodle. So regarding the technology part, because nowadays people no longer use papers and pens to do the calculations or to do the mathematical modeling. So, in the end, we will use some programming language to help us to implement the mathematical models. And specifically in this course, we will use Python, which is a programming language that will help us to do data visualization, data analysis, and also setting up simulations. So we will refer to this, textbook. Which is called the Learn AI Assisted Python Programming. Yeah, so instead of learning this programming language from scratch, we will try to make full use of AI to help us to do the very basic syntaxing. So the way to do it is that we will use this GitHub Copilot, which is your AI programming assistant. So if you have no idea about what this co-pilot can do, let's… let's watch a very short video clip of the introduction. Now that we have cop… So suppose we have installed everything of the environment, and we just… Look at how the co-pilot can help us to, write code. pilot installed in our editors, let's take a look at how to use it. For today's example, I'll be using Python in VS Code. Create a new file called validate underscore email dot pi. Once you start typing, GitHub Copilot will generate suggestions based on what it believes you want to do. For example, I can import the re-module, and when I click enter, Copilot will give me suggested code based on what it believes I want to do. See, when a user just typed the name of this file, valid email, and also imports related libraries, and after hitting the tab button. your co-pilot can guess what you want to write. So here shows an example of define a new function, which is called the valid email. Whereas the input is an email address. And the expected output will be whether this email address is a valid one or not. So this gray text is called the ghost text. It's the co-pilot generated for users. Because the file is named Validate Email, it provides code for validating an email. I can click the top key on my keyboard to accept a suggestion. You see? the, Copilot just generates the, the main body of this function for the users. Basically, we don't have to write anything, so it generates the, two if conditions. So even if you do not know what it is, later we can see that you could ask Copilot to explain the meaning of the code to you, line by line. When I click the return key, it keeps the fun going by providing the main function to run the code. If I hover over the suggested code, I can see the multiple options available to me. I can also open the completions panel to see even more suggestions that's been generated, and accept suggestions from there. This is inline code complete inaction. Where that gray text represents ghost texts that have Copilot's suggestions. If you try this on your machine and you got a different response, that is okay. One thing to keep in mind when you're working with GitHub Copilot or any LLM is that responses are non-deterministic. This means that we're likely to get a different result each time we use GitHub Copilot, and the result I get may differ from the one that you get. We can take this a step further by using GitHub Copilot Chats. Let's say we want to understand what this code means. I'm seeing it for the first time, and I want to get up to speed very quickly. I can open up Copilot Chat and type, slash explain, and get a detailed explanation of what's happening in the code. You'll notice that Copilot Chat has a view of the currently opened files, as indicated by the icon right here. When I click enter, I get a nicely formatted explanation off the code. Yes, so here shows the line-by-line explanation of the meaning of the codes. It's very friendly. Now, let's say I wanted to improve the regex and allow users to enter multiple email addresses. So here, the user would like to change the request for this program. I can make that query right here in Copilot Chat. I can say, allow users to enter multiple email addresses for validation, and also improve the regex to be more robust. Then, I get a plan, An updated code block, and a list of changes that were made. I can click the Apply in Editor button to accept the changes, and GitHub Copilot will go in and make the updates on my behalf. Yeah, so basically, it's like a one… one-stop solution. You have the updated code, and you apply it to the old code, and everything is done. So that is a very, useful tool. People fall. maybe, maybe I'll just jump in as a language teacher, because, I think the copiler was designed primarily for people who at least know some programming. So, raise your hand if you have done zero programming before. Two of you? Okay. Well, again, no worry, alright? So… I would say Copilot would be very helpful for those who actually doing programming. they actually learned how to program without AI before. So, so they, they know how to write a function, where to put the function here and there. So, so that's why autocomplete and everything would be good. But even for people who have zero programming experience, I hope you won't be scared by this particular video, because you could be scared, because you have no idea what's going on here, right? So my suggestion would be… there's a… there's another approach, not necessarily using Copilot. All you have to do is just open up a fresh AI chatbot. And say, you are an experienced programmer with patients working with a non-programmer like me, and then you start to tell the the AI, what you want. You see what I mean? And then… The chatbot can actually give you a framework, you know, try to understand the problem you're trying to solve, and then start from scratch, write a program for you. And then you can move it over to the VS Code and start using Copilot to debug and to improve, you see what I mean? So again, my key message here is, even if you have no idea what is a copilot, even if you have no idea what's a computer program, other than you use the program, because everybody uses the program, right? But very few people write the program. I would say this is a great opportunity for you to cross that threshold. From people who just use the program, to people who actually write the program. Alright, so I hope that that's a little bit of encouragement for you. Yeah, thanks. Thank you, Simon. Yeah, I think, later, because, we have the, in-class exercise session, so we will have chance to, to, to provide exercise for you to get familiar with how this works. And we will, be here to support students to, try this AI-assisted, programming tool. So. Don't worry too much about the technical part. And the point here is how Copilot changes how we learn to program. So in the past, we know that learner spends most of time on the syntax and also the structure of a program. So when talking about syntax, it means that we need to write or type something that the computer can understand. We need to know the, we need to remember those keywords, and also the, punctuations. We need to put them in the correct way. Otherwise, there will be error messages, because the computer cannot, understand, what the, the code means. That will take a lot of time for beginners to program. And also, the syntax is actually language-specific. So, suppose someone is very familiar with Python programming, but if you ask. ask them to program in C++, or some other programming language. Then, they may need to start all over again, starting from scratch again, because the syntax is usually language-specific. So that would take a lot of time. And also, learners need to, spend much time on the structure of the program. Say, they need to understand overall logic, how different parts of the programs are connected with each other, so that will also take a lot of time. But now, with Copilot, as you can see from the video clip. It can generate the basic programs almost immediately, and almost always syntactically and structurally correct. So, what users need to do is to precisely describe the program we want using words. say, I want the function to handle multiple, email addresses. So this is the request. In other words, we write a prompt instead of writing the code by ourselves. So then, how did Copilot do this magic? Well, when we type a prompt, the co-pilot will send our prompt to the LLM, which is the large language model on the internet. And then the OpenAI's GBT large language model will interpret our prompt, and then generate code. So this is how the co-pilot works. Well, you may think that, given that the co-pilot can generate the code for us, then are we done here? So are we just telling the co-pilot assistant, I want to do this and that, and everything will be done by copilot? Actually, it's not that easy. Because during this process, there are still some skills that we need to develop. I think the most important skill with this AI assistant is that we need to develop the skill to break down a large problem into smaller tasks. that Copilot can help us with. So, for example, we cannot, ask Copilot, hey, write me a system to record or to manage all the students' information. Or, hey, write me a computer game. Oh, and make it fun. So this kind of request is… is too much. So that will… those requests are actually quite complicated. And it cannot be handled in one go by Copilot. So, we need to, along this journey, to see how we can break down a very large problem into smaller, tasks that can be handled or can be helped by Copilot. And the second, type of skill will be the prompt engineering. So, the way we talk to our co-pilot should be precise. So this also needs some trial and error, and also need to gain experience with it. Because, sometimes, with even a slightly different way to talk to the co-pilot, the outcome of the code will be quite different. So I think these two skills are, those we still need to pay attention, need to develop, even though we have this, This very friendly, AI… a programming assistant. And then, talking about math, so we will only cover two types of math models in this course. In a previous roadmap, if you still can recall, in our roadmap, Let's go to the roadmap. So, in week 3 and week 4, we will have two case studies. So during the case studies, we will analyze a specific public policy or public management-related problem. And we will see how to, use, the… The mathematical models, I will mention, one is optimization, the other is regression. To study the specific research questions. So, detailed, methodology part will be introduced in third and fourth week. But here, at the, in the first week, now I will just give a very brief overview of the, these two mathematical models. So, the first model, as mentioned, is, optimization. So actually, optimization is seen every day, and many type of problems can be categorized as optimization problems. Especially if you took the Level 1 GE course called Making a Smart Decision. That's a course related to using graph to solve optimization problems. So, giving some examples of optimization in our everyday life. So, for example, when we want to travel from one place to the other. We always try to find the shortest path from one place to the other. The shortest pass. In terms of minimizing the distance between the two, two places, so it's type of optimization. And also, from the perspective of producers, they want to minimize the amount of waste production, and they always want to minimize the cost. And, to also, at the same time, to maximize their profit. Also, the, as a passenger, we always want to have the shortest queuing time, to improve our, user experience. And as a student, you may want to minimize your study time. Whereas, at the same time, to achieve maximizing the, the course, the course score, right? So that's all about the optimization. And the overall objective of doing optimization is to achieve the efficient system operation. In our daily life, when we kind of make decisions, we somehow always want to make the, the so-called smart decision. In a sense that we want to optimize the, the outcome. Well, there are many, classical ways to work on the optimization type of problem. For example, we… we can have a type of, question, which is called the, The, linear programming, where we want… we can write out a very explicit formula for the objective. We want to either minimize it or maximize it, but with certain constraints. So we can also explicitly write out all those constraints in formulas or in functions. And then we try to solve those, equations, then try to find the best solution, which can Achieve our minimization or maximization, while at the same time fulfill all the constraints. But that is a very, theoretical… theoretical thing. We won't introduce any theoretical method to solve the optimization problem. Instead, we will use the so-called simulation modeling. So, to give you an idea of what simulation modeling means. I will show you one of the previous students' work. So I did the, hmm. Sorry, give me a second. Oh. Yep, so this is the, visualization of the, simulation. So the aim of this simulation is to simulate, or you may regard this so-called simulation as a virtual experiment. 2… to simulate this city bus number 56. So, how it behaves… So you can see that there are 3 buttons that can control the simulation. And… The simulations start at 9am. And we assume that the first bus departs at, 9-10. So here, you can see there are two, lines. One is green, the other is purple, so it simulates the two directions of this bus, number 56. One is from Tu Mun to Shengshu, and the other is the backward direction. So, for each direction, you can see these, small circles. Which represent different bus stops. And also, there are… there's percentages behind, below. So this represents our KPI for this simulation. which is the Key Performance Index. It's the, bus seat occupation rate. So during this, simulation, or overall, after this simulation, we want to, calculate. The bus seat… occupation rate, for each bus stop. and see whether, this… these percentages will, like, achieve the threshold set by the Department of Transportation. So, if the percentage is too high. You may imagine that at that stop, there are many people on the bus. That is not good for the, bus safety, and some, some alternative arrangements should be, should be proposed. Whereas, if we find that overall, the bus seat occupation rate is very low for every bus stop. Then, it may be a sign that we may consider reducing the bus frequency. So we can use this simulation data to help us make decisions about the arrangement of the bus frequency. So, for this, AR rear. It provides the live statistics about the overall bus seat utilization, active bus, total passengers, queued passengers. And here is the clock. And on the right-hand side, there will be real-time utilization by stop. So this is the overall, information. And here, at the end, we have the detailed statistics. So for each stop, for each direction, with certain parameters, which I will talk about later. We can calculate the probability of alighting, average seat utilization, and the queue account. So these are the key indices that we, we, we, we, we care. By, by setting up this simulation. So let's maybe run around. I can speed it up. So when I start simulation, the clock starts to click. Now it's 9-10, we have the first bus. So you can see the bus is taking passengers for, the… for different stops. And at the very beginning, because the distance between each pair of bus stops is quite close, so the bus runs very fast. Whereas, when the bus arrives at this… this… Mla Road. The distance between bus stops become longer, so the bus will run slower. So we can set up this, simulation to see how many passengers will get on, on each bus stop. So for each simulation, this number actually is a little bit different. They are just random numbers drawn from a specific distribution. Whereas the parameters of this distribution is based on the data that students collected. So he, took the bus for several times and count the number of people waiting at each bus stop, and also the number of people alight at each stop. So these kind of information will be used to, set up the simulation parameters. So by… Running this kind of simulation for several times, we will have the statistics, E? It's not updated. But it's not working at this moment. But we should have a, a data frame to record the, The, say, the seat utilization for each stop. When we just count the number of people, getting on board and a light, we can know the number of people on the bus. And then divided by the total capacity of the bus to calculate the seat occupation rate. So the, overall, like, setting of simulation will look like this. So instead of using some formulas or some theoretical methods to, study how the system will go, we will set up simulation rather than using the analytical solution. Sure. So, one thing about the simulation… could you… could you open up that again? One thing I think, I think that simulation is, Important about that simulation is that, actually, the simulation was set up based on some data that one of the students went to the field to collect. Alright, so… so I think that's… that's very important, because that would provide some empirical foundation for the simulation. But then at the same time. I think this also raises a very important issue regarding data access. Cuz… If you think about, like, how many passengers are Boarding the bus on a particular time for a particular bus. We should have that data, right? Because… 90% of passengers these days would use either Octopus cards or some other electronic payment. So, the bus company actually has the data. So instead of, us going to do some sampling, only count, you know, with limited manpower to do That kind of counting. The argument could be, You know, what if the bus company just shared data? You see what I mean? So, part of what we're trying to do in this course, through our project, is to showcase and to make a convincing argument that If we manage the data better. If we take the data that's necessary for the investigation, for the research, from the right people. Then we will have much better outcome. Right? But that's the whole point, that's what we are talking about, like, data governance. How do we manage data? Data governance is a whole journey, right? It starts with… collecting the data. Cleaning the data, curating the data, and then you can start using the data to analyze things and making decisions. That's a whole process, a whole journey. We want to find out to what extent the Transport Department, in this case, Is managing the data. We're gonna write to them and say, look, we have this bus routes change, or update. Have you got data from the KMB? Have you got the data from the bus company? Right? Maybe they don't. Then we have a problem here. Because there's untapped potential. When it comes to Analyzing the data, because the data is there. But the data is not available, has not been used. for analysis. That's the untapped. potential. So that's my comments. Now, my question is, Given the limited amount of data we have, For building this simulation. To what extent this is actually useful. Or how do we actually assess the usefulness or validity of this simulation? Yeah, I think that is a good question. I think the usefulness of the modeling really depends on the data quality. To say, if we do not go to the field, if we do not really count the number of people who get on at each stop, we will have no idea what's happening in reality. So I think the model, the validity of the model. Depends a lot on the, the accurate estimation of the key parameters. Specifically, in this example, it will be the number of passengers who go on board and a light. But for other, other cases, it'd be… it might be some other, Data that can be used to determine the key parameter in the model. I think only we can have a quite accurate estimation of these parameters. Can we set up the… can we have the relatively accurate, Mimic or simulation of the reality. I think another… another point is that the overall logic of setting up the simulation should be correct. I think with these two components, both of them are accurate. I think the, ability of the simulation, of the modeling, can be… can be guaranteed. I mean, the validity of the model can be guaranteed. But a quick follow-up question is, we built this whole thing based on some data we collected from the field, but then what's the… what's the purpose of doing this simulation? Yeah, okay, so this is just to show you the idea of what a simulation is, and the problem actually comes from here. So every year, the Department of Transportation will collect the information from bus companies. to propose this bus route planning program. So every year, they will have such kind of proposal. And in this proposal, they will, they will say, well, based on certain, certain, certain, information or criteria, we decided to adjust the arrangement for the following bus routes. For example, they will have this kind of table. Which has very detailed, record of for which bus company, which bus road, how will the bus road adjusted, whether the frequency will be different, or whether the route will be different. However, we find that those criteria to adjust these bus services are actually quite vague. So they say that, well, based on our survey, or based on our counsel with the residents nearby, we find that the frequency is not enough. The wordings are just qualitative and without any quantitative justification. So that's the reason we set up the simulation. And later, we can actually change some key settings in this simulation. For example, now, for this simulation, the frequency of the bus is set as 30 minutes. We can actually change this setting and see if We change the bus frequency to 20 minutes. What will happen? How exactly will the seed occupation rate change? How exactly the passenger waiting time, on average, will be reduced. We can… Measure this change in a quantitative way. So that it will be more convincing to make certain decisions. I think this is, mentioned here. So why do we do simulation? Because Simulation can be used to model relatively complex systems. So there's people, getting on a board and a light. Along with different bus stops, it's actually a quite complex system. But we can actually use simulation to assess the dynamic system behavior. So we can use this as a virtual experiment to see what will happen if we change some settings in this virtual experiment. So simulations can also be used to explore the hypothetical situation and answer the what-if scenarios. Say, if we change the road. Say, if there is a new station, inserting here… then we have a different distance between, say, these two bus stops and the other two bus stops. We can, again. quantify. the seat occupation rate for each stop, and also the average waiting time for the passengers. We can see how exactly will be changed. And also, it can be used to test new solutions in a cheaper and safer manner. So we just do it virtually first, before we really take any actions to change the bus route or change the frequency. Did I answer a question? So, I suppose, We can also use simulation as a tool to answer the question, what if we have more data? Or what if we have a better data governance? Is… is that… is that possible? Yeah, I think at least we could, have the more… qualitative answer for those questions. Rather than just a very vague argument about what will happen, we can know what exactly will happen. with stimulation. do you want to break first? Yeah, maybe we have a 5-minute break first. We should be able to finish a bit early today here. Okay, so let's resume. So we just talked about the simulation, and the example of bus number 56 is just to give you an intuitive understanding of what a simulation will look like. So here is more detail about the simulation modeling. So it is about mimicking the usually complex systems. Normally over time, so in the bus, simulation, it's indeed over time. And using logic, math, and computers. So actually, the mass content in the… behind the simulation is not that much, so as long as you know, three types of distributions, then it's done. So, it is just the, Level 1, Level 1… Level 1 math… not math course, actually, it's the, you know, there is a course for all science faculty students. It's the introduction to Mathematics and Statistics. all of the math content in this course, either the simulation or the linear regression, won't exceed that requirement. So it won't involve any year two or above math content. And simulation is an experimental process. As mentioned, we run and rerun the model many, many times under different scenarios to predict the system behavior and evaluate performance under each scenario. And to implement the simulation, we'll mainly use SynPy, so this is the ISON library. We will talk more about it in week 3. And there are, other type of questions that we may be interested, about the public management or public policies, but those type of questions cannot be answered by, optimization. So that type of questions may, may be like, for example. How population density impacts the demand for public services. Or, what is the relationship among public opinion, political trust, and public satisfaction? So, to know the benefit of knowing the answers of these questions. Can be used to inform the public resource allocation and also the development of sustainable cities. And also, knowing, for example, the answer of the second question. It can help us to assess the government performance and legitimacy, legitimacy. So one of the examples, we will, look into details is a case study about the supportiveness for the garbage bag charging scheme. So by scanning this QR code, you can find the, questionnaire survey that, conducted by a previous student. So it's all about the influencing factors of the supportiveness for the garbage bag charging scheme. So to answer these type of questions, we would use the linear regression model. So this type of model is used to study or to clarify the relationship between a dependent variable, which is most of the time the variable that we're interested, like the supportiveness of the charging scheme. And one or more independent variables that may explain why people have different opinions on the, this garbage bag charging scheme. Assuming that their relationship is, is linear. And the model will be built, or will be fitted based on the collected data. So if you, open this questionnaire, you can see that every question is actually used to collect relevant data. And as mentioned, we will not use paper and pens to build up the model, to estimate the parameters. Instead, we would use, Python to help us So, to implement this linear regression, we will use scikit-learn, which is a very popular Python library to work on many types of machine learning models. And actually, this linear regression is one typical example of machine learning models. Okay, that will be all the technology and math involved in this, course. And, one supplementary is that when we talk about the simulation for the bus. During the, data collection process. We actually identified some missing data. For example, like, the passengers' load data. So, we actually sent an email to the Department of Transportation to ask whether they have, whether they have collected the operational and passenger flow data. And whether they have other kind of data, say the public consultation data, when they make the decision to change the frequency or the route of certain bus. And also, whether they can make those data available for us. Because if the data is already there, we don't have to bother to collect the data by ourselves. So this is, I think, the link between, the, the math part and also the, the data governance part, of this course. So during the mathematical modeling or the quantitative approach, we may identify some gaps in the data governance. So that's the, supplementary part. Alright, thank you, thank you, Talia. Again, I think, For students with strong math background, those, like, from the math department, this is a good opportunity For us to try to apply the math skills to solve a real-world problem. Whereas for those with, limited math background, or hasn't done much math recently, I think this is, I think it's a good opportunity to expand one's toolkit. I'm not saying that necessarily you will become a very proficient user of these tools. By the end of this course, but at least you will be aware of such options. You are aware that these tools are available. It is possible to do this kind of modeling, this kind of analysis, that can gain more insights. And that awareness is important because when you work in a team. It's not a matter of how much you know, or how many skills you can master. It's a matter of how you can work with different people. Especially if you're a leader. You need to know how to bring together all the people from different backgrounds and work together. And by taking this course, you will become much more comfortable working with someone with the math skills, with the programming skills. comparatively, if you don't take this course, alright? So I hope that that's, that's, clear. kind of… argument for… for… Give it a try. Now, let's, go back to the roadmap. Again, this is a work in progress, but if you come to… this… First week, we actually got some week one materials in addition to what Taliot Just show us the slides. And, can you come to this page? week one index, because I… I try to, Design the page in such a way that you can interact with it. And then, there could be a report to be generated as a result. I don't know exactly, you know, whether it's going to work, because actually we built this through VIP… VIP coding, VIP programming. So, you see, the HTML was written, with AI assistance. So, so this is… the whole, the whole interface was not… Using any, like, off-the-shelf tools. Alright, so, yeah, so we have some interactive lecture, just a little bit. I want to go back… I don't think I want to cover everything, because, you know, this is just, just first week, but I do want to talk a little bit about this, this case, alright? Now, this is the case, about bus app. Do you use Bus App? Raise your hand, right? Everybody uses bus apps these days, because when you have a bus app, you don't… have to go to the bus stop early, right? Especially if it's the bus stop near your home, you can look at the bus app and say, oh, only 3 minutes. You know, the bus will come, then you go down and you catch the bus. Nope. The problem that I'm talking about here, I don't know whether you run this problem yourself. But I… I've got 2 bus stops. One is on this side of the street, another is across the street. And these two bus stops got the same name. Does this make sense? It got the same name. So on the app, There's these two bus stops. With the same name, And that confused me. You know, I was in a hurry. I was in a hurry, so I look at it, but I said, oh, there's 3 minutes or something. I go down there. But it's actually the other side of the bus. 3 minutes. But this side, It's already gone. So for me, that's a problem. Okay? So when I got a problem, I tried to solve it. So I write to the transport department. About 2 years ago. Alright, so there's a back and forth, back and forth email. If you are interested, I can share that with you, but… At the end of the day, what happened was, because I ran into this issue all the time. So one day, I decided to write to the assistant director of the transport department. Okay? Because there's a director of the transport department, there are two assistant directors. One of the assistant directors is in charge of all the transportation services, including technical things or something. Anyway. I write to him. And I said, you know, I think it's Mr. Ho, I said, you know, we have this whole issue, blah blah blah, I've been talking with the transportation, your staff, your colleagues for a long time. It's never resolved. And they said, you know, you probably have never taken bus, you know, in the past 10 years or even 20 years, you know, because you're a senior member in the government. but maybe you want to come and try this, or blah blah blah, instead. And then I told him, you know, I write for South China Morning Post, I have connection with lawmakers. And maybe you can get this done, you know, solve this problem so I don't have to escalate this problem further to even more senior people. Alright, so I wrote this email, and eventually. The bus company puts some number. next to the bus stop. So they didn't change the name. The name is still the same, but they changed the… The, put a code. So we can distinguish. Now, the case… The case highlights some two issues. The first issue is about data governance. Alright? It's a very simple matter. We need clean and high-quality data. When you have two bus stops with the same name, that's not clean data. That's not high-quality data. And that would cause confusion. Alright? So that's the first issue. I think in this course, we talk about the data governance. That's a small step we should take to make sure that all the data is clean. And with high quality, and it's accessible. Right? The second issue, When you see something wrong, can you actually make a difference? Can you pressure the government? To make a difference. And my story, somehow, Suggests that it is possible. Well, it's not a big deal, right? Most people will just let it go. Right? You, you, you, next time you check the app, you check it more carefully. But I don't know how to let it go, because it's their problem, it's their mistake. They shouldn't put too… Bus stops with the same name, you see what I mean? So if you keep trying it. You will create some pressure for the government staff, and from time to time, they may have to respond, they may have to do something. You see what I mean? So, I think that's also a very important foundation or premise of this course. Because… To some extent, the government of this city still responds to The members of the public. If you do it the right way, Okay? So, if you still… Somehow you see the government is doing something wrong, or it's not… you know, there's some room for improvement. There's still opportunity to convince them to do things better. I think that's the whole point, you know? Otherwise, if we're talking about a government that does not listen to ordinary people like us at all. Then there's no point to… to run this course. You saw me? But, I hope this case can somehow convince you that it is possible, so I didn't, I mean, you can try this… This, question yourself. So what is the problem here? It's a… it's a data governance problem, alright? It is a data governance problem. Alright, so, yeah, I hope, I hope that makes sense. And, again, I don't want to spend too much time here, even though there's some materials you can just go home and try it yourself. But, I do want to also take the opportunity to… invite you to try an AI tutor. As Tayle mentioned, in this course, we are going to use different AI tools. And GitHub Copilot is one of them. you know, Copilot is an AI tool that can, Help us to write codes. Which is very useful. And the large language model is… It's very powerful, because it can understand people's texts, understand people's message somehow, to what extent, to some extent. and then respond in a human-like manner. So, writing code is one use case. Now, I want to share with you another use case. So, can you all access this page? Okay? So, let me see what's the best way for me to, So, if you go all the way down here, week one, you can see there's a launched AI Tutor, that's one way. Another way you can, access this page. is… If you go to our Google Docs. Yeah. Oh. Oh, okay. Alright, maybe I just quickly, set up a QR code. So everybody will be able to… I think that… This is the cocktail. Okay, so once you… Once you, scan the QR code, You will come to… a… page, And… I put the link at the very top. So you can see there's the… AITutor.hkbu.tech. Slash chat, slash, discuss prep. Can you all access? No. Before you try this tool, I need to explain to you The concept of customized chatbot. Okay? So, have you heard of customized chatbot before? Raise your hand. Okay, so, where did you, learn about customized chatbot. Have you used any of them? These are my own websites, and then I'm at a chat box on it, and connect the… P-O-E-A-P-I. I'm just the PoE API, just update in the, 1 August. just… Train the model, give it the prompt, and then… It will customize the… Assistant for my website to answer the… The custom bar. That's pretty cool. Because I never figured out the poll API. It is the more recent feature, right? Because, the reason that I'm using the PoE, because, every day, it have, Some quota. Some free credit for me to, use the API key. Oh, cool. So, the ChatGBT needs the VPN, and… other models, such as DeepSeek, and Need Money. I see, yeah, I see. Yeah, you're pretty advanced. Anyone else have learned the customized chatbot before? Try a customized chatbot before? So what's your, what's your motivation? Maybe you can explain to us what is a customized chatbot? just, pre-write a whole prompt, which is a setting, telling the AI that, what is the role, what is your purpose, who am I, what should you answer me, and, some background of what your Yes. Gotta communicate with it. Yes, very good. So that is how you personalize it. Right. So the idea of, customized travel is that we write some system prompt behind the scene. Alright? In fact, every chatbot is a customized chatbot. You know? Because the company always writes something behind the scenes. If you talk to a general, generic chaplain and say. Teach me how to build an atomic bomb. Or just any bomb, okay? Atomic bomb is too difficult. The chatbot would say, sorry, I can't help you, right? The chatbot would not go ahead and give you all the instructions on how to build a bomb. Why? It's because behind the scenes, the developer has written down something saying that, oh, if people ask you a crazy question or whatever, they… you have to refuse it. That's system problem. But what we are talking about here is that we as the developer, we as the teacher, or even, even, like, anybody, can write some system prompt behind the scenes, and then next time, that chatbot will run the system prompt. We'll follow the system prompt to behave in certain ways. Okay. Now, actually, in the past 2 years, I've been doing pretty much the similar things as you did, but we use OpenRouter. the API of OpenRooter, because they provide the tokens. And we built a system to customize the chatbot, but recently, I have to shut it down, because there's some privacy issue. So instead. We… we got a workaround. It's, it's a… it's, kind of like a makeshift, solution. So today, I just want to give you a quick kind of introduction, and you can get a chance. You know, this is very fresh. you know, I built a prototype first, and then my assistant built this, and then I was still trying to kind of, deployed it into some server, you know, it took me quite some time to make this happen. But anyway, when you… when you come to this page, it takes a little bit of setup, okay? So please be patient. What you have to do is to go to the HKBU General AI platform. So how many of you use that platform regularly, the ITO's platform, HKBU? Do you know there's a platform there? It's… it's called genai.hkbu.edu.hk, so you go there, please, everybody. Go to genai.hkbu. dot edu.h. Oh, you, you come here, and there's a link, okay? It says, get your key from HKBU GenAI platform. Then you have to log in. You have to log in. And, once you log in, you go to a page. That page would give you, there's a UI, you click Generate Key. Generate key, and then… You will be able to… Get a key. Okay, once you get that key. Keep it in a safe place, okay? Because otherwise, you have to go back and generate another key, okay? So, and don't share it with others, it's your key. If you share with others. other people will use it, and… and do bad things, maybe? You see what I mean? So that key, you can enter it onto… the previous page. Okay, it takes a little time to set it up. But once it's set up, The key will be cached, will be kept in the cache, so… So, you don't have to enter it again, but again, you keep it somewhere safe, okay? Go down to the, top, down left, left. Yeah, there's the API, you see API? Yeah. So there's an API service, everybody with me? Can you find the API service? Yes? No? the, the bottom. Oh, maybe he does not have it. For the setting. Can you… can you try that link? If you don't have that API service, you need to email ITO, okay? you email ITO using your HKBU email address and say, you know, I'm, hoo-hoo-hoo, you know, from which department, student, I need an API key for the HKBU General AI service. No… What is API? How many of you know what is an API? If you're a computer scientist, you must know, right? How about other… other, student, maybe, maybe I can briefly explain what is, what is API. API stands for Application Programming Interface. Alright? So before you… you… before we talk about API, first you need to know what is the interface. Okay? Interface is the very important concept. So what is interface? Sometimes we talk about user interface, or UI. So interface is like when you communicate or interact with somebody, with a separate entity. you need some kind of interface, right? So how do you… Intel with computer. When you interact with the computer, you have to send something to the computer, and you have to get something back from the computer. That's a two-way strict, right? So how do you send things to computer? People, right? Mouse. You know, before GUI, before Windows, we don't have mouse, we just keyboard. Type. And then later, what do you have? Micro… microphone, right? Scanner. webcam. So, this is all input device. And there's output device. What is the output device? Speaker, monitor, right? And there's many other output devices, you know, you can… hard… even… even hard drive is the output device, right? You, you output a file, save it back to the… to the hard disk. So we have input and output, and there's an interface. Now, imagine! You are going to communicate with the server many… miles away. It could be a server in Singapore or in America. You need to talk to that server. Okay? You need to talk to that server. How do you talk to that server? You… you can't use keyboard, right? You can't use… microphone, or whatever, the conventional way of using computer. You have to write codes. Okay, so you have a program, okay? You have a program, you only talk to that server, or talk to another program. How does it communicate? It communicates through some kind of agreement. Some kind of protocol. Okay, so you write the program in such a way that the program will send some message over to the other program, and then the other program will send back some message back to you. And that whole agreement or protocol is called API. Okay, it's called Application Programming Interface. I hope that interface is somewhat comparable to the computer interface I used earlier. I don't know whether I'm doing a good job explaining. But sometimes you don't… you don't necessarily have to know all the details, like, how it works. All you have to know is that API is a technology that allows you to write some program that can communicate with a different program. So instead of relying on a Graphical user interface. You can write a program to do it. and the API key… is… is the key you need to access the server, basically. If you don't have the key, the server won't Accommodate or process your request. So, literally, it's a key. Yeah, it's okay. to open. To unlock the door. So, do you got your key? But you can, you can enter it, right? Yeah, I need to do a demo, Tony, Johnny Goba. Okay. Right. So, once you enter the key, you just click Connect. And once you click connect, you see there's the… Welcome message. So this is actually a very generic, chatbot. It's called Socratic Dialogue Partner. Alright. And we actually put, The system prompt here, for your information, if you want to… if you're curious, what this is… the whole thing is about, you can know this is a system prompt. So basically, every time when you write a message and send it to the chatbot, the system prompt will be sent to The large language model as well. So that's how the system prompt is working, to tell the travel what to do. Okay? And then, well, this one, you can, you can try anything. You can, you can just, you know, explore ideas, blah blah blah. But actually, the… Recently, I tried this… I tried this and asked some questions, I found that the performance is not very good. I suspect that the ITO has done something somehow, you know, to… for safety reasons or whatever. Because I put the same prompt into our own platform, it's performed much better. So actually, I tried to… I tried to, edit The, the prompt quite a bit. But anyway, I'll just do a quick demo. I, So this chatbot was designed to help you to explore some problems or questions. So suppose in… during the class, I raised a question, the teacher raised a question. And you can discuss with your friends, your classmates, but then at the same time, you can discuss with the AI. So, my question here is, how can we apply data science to help Hong Kong government make better decisions? Okay. So, yeah, it's… it's a little bit slow. It's an intriguing topic. What kind of decision do you think the Hong Long Island could improve most by using social aspect. So I think there's something wrong with the… either the prompt or the model. But anyway, So I say, take public health as an example, promote flu shot. Promoting flu shots is a classic public health challenge. What do you think are the main barriers that prevent people from getting vaccinated against the flu? Well, you kind of get the idea, because we designed the system problem in such a way that it won't give you the strict answer, you see what I mean? So instead of the AI giving you the answer, they will guide you, will give you all the kind of guiding questions, and so you can try to answer, and you can try to explore. This is the idea of Socratic method. So, and, it's, what do you think is the main barrier that prevents people from getting vaccinated against the flu? I say it's lack of, education and marketing? You brought up, like, of what connection do you see between these two concepts? Hmm. I think it's pretty dumb. But anyway, so, the idea is that we can actually set up different system prompts And different chatbots that, that would be able to engage you, you know, engage the students. Yeah, maybe, maybe, Okay, so this, this is, this is one demo, and you can always look at the system prompt and, And suggest… explore how we can do a better job. Now, if you… if you click back. If you click back, you actually… we have a kind of, because we only got a couple of, chatbots, so right now we have a… we have an index page like this. So you can… you can go to another chatbot, which is GCAP, Social Issues Analyst. So this one is also, something you can try, and I think this one is designed just for… for this course, It's called… just change the discussion prep to GCAP, analysis. It's already connected. Alright? And you can see the system from here. I'm here to help you analyze complex social and public health issues for your GCAP course. It's not just public health, right? To start, please describe the issue you're exploring, or type menu. So now you… we can… we can… we set up to… to be able to type the manual. So you can type the manual. So there's a data-driven analysis of an article. Formulating an information request or selecting a mathematical model. Right, so maybe we can say we select the mathematical model. So what is the problem here? So let's say the problem is how to adjust bus frequency of the route. See, it's getting dumb again. It's, it's, we… I think we are still, just, kind of, testing this, but the purpose of, of today's demo is just so everybody can be on board and can start, talking to this To this chairboard, okay? What is the main goal of adjusting the bus frequency? Okay, anyway, now, suppose you have done this chat, talking with the chatbot, you can click the check. And then there will be a learning session report. generated. With the entire chat history printed out. And also a little bit of statistics, like, how many messages there are. The number of messages you send, And a summary. Okay. So… yeah. And then you can download it, or you can copy it. See, there's the… report here. Okay, so, I will try to… Improve this a bit. So, it will be useful. But, you get the idea, right? So, we will have some customized chatbot that can support different learning modules. In this course. Right? And, hopefully… This will become a… A set of learning buddies, or learning companion for you. Alright, so, you know, throughout the course, if you have any questions, you will be able to consult the chatbot. And the chapel was designed in such a way that they can offer you intelligent… answers based on the context of this course, not just a general chapel, right? Because if you talk to a general chapel. they have no idea what you are learning. You have to spend some time telling the chapel what you are trying to do. Okay. Any question about this? this platform. Again, we are using the API technology, the technology from BU, so it's safe. Because the university has got some policies about privacy, about security, and when we are using the university technology, then we don't have to worry about those issues. But we still have to consider and explore how to make the technology actually useful. So, there's… there's something we have to, work on a little bit more. Alright? Any… any other questions? But I hope you will find this approach quite interesting. Because now we… we can, have a more personalized learning experience. Alright. So maybe we can take another… Do you want to take a short break, or we just… Finish. Do you… do you want to talk about the Jupyter Notebook, or we can talk about it next… next week? Yeah, because for next week, we will have some hands-on, work on the, Jupyter Notebook, actually Python programming with the help from GitHub Copilot. So, in the Moodle, if you go back to Moodle… Oh, very smooth. Then we have to reopen. So if we go back to Moodle in the references section. I actually put the Chapter 2 of our reference Which is the Learning AI Assisted Programming. Chapter 2, which is about how to set up the co-pilot. So, to get an education version of GitHub Copilot, you need to register a GitHub account using your Hong Kong BU email. So that will, make you have enough, like, number of messages to communicate with Copilot GitHub, Copilot, GitHub Copilot. So here is a very detailed, steps to install everything, including Python, VS Code, and how to set up the co-pilot. So, I think for the remaining time, if you want to do it on-site, I will be here in case you have any questions on this. Otherwise, you can choose to do it by yourself when you are back. another… Another thing is about the value of this course, so without any further information, all of the courses will take place here, at RS905, rather than OEE501. Yeah. Are we gonna use that, computer at some point? Probably later, right? I actually don't think so. Okay. All right, so, yeah, as Taylor said, if you want to set it up, if you need some help, feel free to stay and do that. Otherwise, we'll see you next week. My final words will be, like, I would like to thank you for your openness to be willing to try a new course, because this is the first year for this course to… to… to start. You know, we really appreciate that you… you are, open to this new opportunity. See you next week. Very good timing. That is all for… It's okay, Andy. We're suspended button. How come you, you… Awesome, awesome. He's one of my interns. Yeah, I think… Okay, he, he, he, he asked about the bandwidth. She didn't ask for time, like, something I was at the time. Envy. Let me know why I didn't Sure. Oh, what about, what about legal clothes and material, right? Fantastic. Introduction. Good chocolate.
