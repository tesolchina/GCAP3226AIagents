# Week 3 Lecture Transcript Formatting

## Course Logistics and Project Overview

**Simon Wang:** The first thing is we got a WhatsApp group. And, please do join, because, this way we'll be able to interact more closely. If you haven't joined, please join. Anyone who is new, Just join… oh, okay, welcome. So you missed the first two weeks. You need to catch up a little bit, so, And also, I'm recording this, so anyone who wants to catch up and you can watch the video.

So, as you can see, this is our Moodle classroom. We're still doing a little bit of paperwork. I think the course is already approved. It's just a matter of, some formality? We have a WhatsApp group here, please join if you haven't. And we have a Google Doc, and that's just basically for week 1 and Week 2. And then you can see, I'm trying to, rearranged, so it's reverse chronological order, so we have week one, there's on PDF… And then there's the… Week 2 and Week 3. And then there's also video recording from week 1 and Week 2. Alright? So, feel free to catch up here.

And then, if you come to… this page… from… in-class and after-class discussion, so this is the Moodle forum. And once you join the… enter this page, you will be able to see today we're going to talk about the group project instruction and timeline.

So… This project would be the… most important components in terms of assessment, because there's some other presentation, reflective essay, and human-AI collaboration notes. Those are the things that will build upon this core project that you have to form the groups and you need to work on. So that's why today, we're going to… Focus on talking about how to start your project. hopefully, I will finish in… half an hour, okay? Half an hour or something.

## Group Formation and Topic Selection

**Simon Wang:** In the meantime, you can start thinking about different possible topics. So, here, you can find a total of 8 topics. Alright? So, you can click into any of them and start exploring a little bit. If you are interested in any of them, you can leave a message. Another way to do this is to look around and see if there are any of your friends taking this course, anyone you know you want to form a team. You can form a team first, and then come here and explore topics. Okay, so either way will work. But the bottom line is, I hope, we hope, everybody will get a team and find a topic by the end of this week. Right?

So, Because the first two weeks is, I mean, the first two weeks after the airdrop period, you need to start working on the project, and Talia will also continue to introduce some tools, mass models, that you can use for this project. Okay. So, yeah, so please start looking at the topics, And, Also, take a look at the timeline. Okay, so can everybody… Find this page. This is the group project instruction and timeline. Moodle forum post. And, you should also be able to find this page. So this page is where you can find this post, as well as all the other topics.

Alright, so just a show of hands, how many of you already got team members? you know who you want to work with. Raise your hand. Okay?

The group size is 4 to 6. Okay? So, 4 to 6 is kind of a pretty flexible range here. if you want to form a smaller group, or… I don't think larger group will work. Smaller group, maybe you can talk to us. We will… You know, review and decide.

Now, for those of you who do not know each other yet. You might want to leave a message to the WhatsApp group, or you want to introduce yourself, you want to say hi. Ideally, I hope each group would have at least one computer science or math major. Okay. this will kind of make life a bit easier, you know, and also the idea of offering this GE course is to practice and promote transdisciplinary thinking and teaching and learning. So, when we have someone from math or quantitative background, programming background, working with students from more qualitative background, I think that's exactly what we want, the kind of, combination.

But of course, if you came to our course in week one and week 2, you can already experience the power of AI. So, you can think of AI as your partner, right? So even if you do not have the background in programming or quantitative reasoning, you know, you can always talk to AI. So, that being said… I would still encourage students to form teams that would have some team members from math and computer science, or science in general.

So that's why maybe we should, because I think some students are still coming, so how about we just raise your hand if you are from computer science? Raise your hand. Hello! Tony, raise your hand if you're from computer science. Okay, Tony, and, so maybe we'll invite the computer science major to just introduce yourself a bit. But we have divided… we have a group already. You have a group already? Still, you can say hi.

**Bonnie:** I'm Bonnie, and I'm a Year 4 Computer Science student, And… yes.

**Simon Wang:** Okay. And Tony?

**Tony:** I'm totally… feel free to talk to me.

**Simon Wang:** Yeah, that's a good offer. Alright, so, both of you are in the WhatsApp group, right? Okay, anyone who is not in the WhatsApp group? Right? So what about others? Any math major? Okay, math major. Let's maybe say hi to everyone, and introduce yourself.

**Amy:** Hi everyone, I'm Amy, and I'm here for math students.

**Simon Wang:** Okay. Alright, I'm sure there are other computer science and math majors in this course. Maybe, just, you can leave a message to the WhatsApp group, and, yeah, again, you know, just, hopefully you'll get to know each other and, and, form the groups.

## Project Mission and Timeline

**Simon Wang:** Alright, so if you recall what we discussed in the last two weeks. The purpose of this course is to synergize quantitative reasoning with qualitative reasoning. And our goal is to review how the government staff practice data governance. Because we believe that decisions made by the government staff should be informed by data. So that's the very basic premise. And starting point of this course. But we do not know to what extent the government is doing that. So that's why we're doing this project. Okay

And we have a timeline. In the first, I mean, in the first two weeks after Eddrop, I always say it's two… Week 3 and week 4, we're going to explore the topics, all right? So you have the opportunity to look at different possibilities, you'll form the teams, and you'll learn a bit more about the math modeling, math tools that we're going to apply.

And by week 5, we're going to finalize the topic, and in week 5, we're going to have small group meetings. Alright. Week 6 happens to be the public holiday, but that's when you can Both week 6 and week 7, you can start collecting more data. You need to send the request to the government staff. the specific department under the code on access to information. Alright, so that's the tool we're going to use. We call this secret weapon, because not many people are aware of this. So we're going to approach the specific government department and ask them questions about how they make decisions. We want to evaluate their decision-making process, and to see to what extent data has been used. My guess… Is that not much? Okay? So we're going to find out that the government staff are not really using that much of data, or taking this, what we call, data-driven approach. to making decisions.

And then… We have to show them. How they can do a better job. Okay? So this is our mission of this course. We are going to look at the specific decisions made by the government. And after looking at what they are making the decision now, we are going to use the mass models, we're going to apply the mass models to some data. So we're gonna make an argument. The argument is that the government can do a better job by using data. This is actually in line with the chief executive's promise. You know, tomorrow, The chief executive will issue his new policy address. But if you look at the previous policy addresses, you can see that the chief executive promised to apply more data Okay, to use more data-driven approaches for governance. So our course is also helping the government to do what they promise to do.

## Project Stages

### Stage 1: Topic Selection and Review

**Simon Wang:** So, the first stage. The first thing you have to do is to select a specific decision made by the government. Okay? So one of the mistakes or pitfalls you want to avoid Is to just pick a broad topic. Without being able to narrow it down to something more specific. And the 8 topics that I offer you, in most topics, we already have something pretty concrete, except topic number 8. Topic number 8 is much more open-ended. Okay? So once you pick that specific policy area and a specific decision, you can then start reviewing different information documents… News media reports, you know, from the internet. And you will get a sense whether or not data-driven approach is being adopted. Okay.

### Stage 2: Data Collection

**Simon Wang:** And then stage 2, you need to start collecting some data. There are multiple sources for such data collection. One important website you want to go to, you can visit right away, is data.gov.hk. Okay? Go to data.gov.hk, you will be able to see a lot of different quantitative data being provided by different government departments, or even some organizations or companies. That's the first source of data and information.

The second source, as I mentioned earlier, we need to write to the government and request information. The deadline for sending that request is by week 6, because we have to wait for another 3 weeks before we get any substantive reply. Sometimes it can up to… can be up to 7 weeks. So, week 6, we send the government request of data, of information. That's how we will get a sense of how they actually apply the data-driven approach to decision-making.

So by week 7, You know, you have a, holiday, In week 6? We should have a data inventory table, which means you got all the different data from different sources, it's all compiled, and you will be able to see a table. We should have sent all the requests. Of information to the government by email, total access to information. And, you can also do a little bit of fieldwork. Okay? So there are different forms of fieldwork you can do, just collect a little bit of information and data there as well. Field work is very important, because most likely. The government staff did not yet collect or curate all the data. That they're supposed to do, then we have to do a little bit of fieldwork to demonstrate this is actually feasible.

### Stage 3: Analysis and Argumentation

**Simon Wang:** Now, stage 3, after you have done all the exploration and all the data preparation, collection, now you will start analyzing the data, applying the mass models and tools As well as the critical thinking skills that we teach in this course. And this is why this course is co-hosted, mainly hosted by a maths department, but then co-taught by me from the Language Center. So, Dr. Wu, She's going to spend more time today As well as next week, in the coming weeks, to introduce the mass models. As well as some programming techniques, so we can visualize the data.

So the basic idea is that we are going to do a demo. To the government staff. Because you can't just write. An essay, or argument, and say, look, you have to apply or adopt data-driven approach to governance. You can't just say that. You have to make a convincing argument. How do you make a convincing argument? About this. We make a convincing argument By doing it, Okay? So, we're gonna show… to the lawmakers. And also the government staff that… It is feasible. and highly… Rewarding. To apply the data, To apply the data-driven approach, to make decisions. And regrettably, The government staff haven't been doing that. Okay? So you can see, this argument can be very powerful. If we do it right, And we have all the channels, we have all the infrastructure. To disseminate that message. If we do a good job, To make a strong argument. I have connection with the lawmakers, I have different mechanisms To send that message to the lawmakers, the legislative councils, even to the Chief Executive's Office. Actually, I don't have any special connection. All I do is just email them. But we do also, published letters in South China Morning Post. So, that's another way to… Make our voice heard.

And then, after we build the argument, we make the recommendations, we will present. Okay, so we will have a presentation session. We're still talking with the lawmaker. We might run a session in the Legislative Council complex, so that's still to be announced. So I hope that makes sense. I mean, the whole post is pretty self-explanatory, so I'm… I won't get into all the details. Any questions? Any questions? Okay, good, we're good.

## Overview of Potential Project Topics

**Simon Wang:** Alright, so, very briefly, see, maybe 2 minutes per topic.

### Topic 1: Bus Frequency Optimization

**Simon Wang:** Topic number 1. Actually, the first three topics are all about bus. Okay? Because, you know, somehow we got a lot of data, we got a lot of experience about buses, all right? So the first one is about the bus frequency, so how we can optimize bus frequency. There's a lot of trade-offs here. You know, ideally, we should increase the frequency as much as we can, right? But then you have to consider resources, and also, if there are too many buses on the road, there will be close traffic jams. You see what I mean? So, we need to optimize. We have to take into consideration different factors. Currently, because the franchise buses company, they got a franchise from the government, so the government, the transport department, actually have a lot of influence on how the decision is being made regarding bus frequency. Okay, so from here, you'll be able to see a lot of, information. You know, we have done a lot of… quite a bit of work on this already. So… If you are interested in this, you can… Go further. One important thing I want to highlight is that even though we're looking at a case study. Whatever solution, whatever argument we're going to make, can be scaled up to improve the bus service of the entire city. So, so, I hope you won't treat it as just a trivial case. Because there is the potential to scale up. Alright, whatever argument we make, It can… it has the potential to improve everybody's life. Okay, because everybody take buses, right? I mean, except the super rich, of course.

### Topic 2: Merging Bus Stops

**Simon Wang:** Alright, the second one, is about, how we can There's the case for merging two bus stops. You know, that are pretty close, okay? Again, you can scale up the case. Even though this is just one case from my neighborhood, we can look through All the different geographical locations of different bus stops and see there might be other cases as well.

### Topic 3: Coordinating Overlapping Bus Routes

**Simon Wang:** The third one… It's about, how we could coordinate Different bus routes that may have overlap. Imagine there are two bus routes covering a big… Chunk of bus stops. overlapping. Then, if we coordinate the bus routes. So, the buses will come more evenly. Is that me? And that would actually improve the… Passenger experience. And for that to happen, we need to use simulation. Okay, we need to use some mass tools to demonstrate this could happen. Alright, so that's the first two, three topics all about the public transportation.

### Topic 4: Municipal Solid Waste Charging Scheme (Public Perception)

**Simon Wang:** Number 4… It's about, municipal solid waste charging scheme. Well, actually, the government has already shelved the scheme. We have no idea whether they're going to revisit it. But we have done some work on this already. We have done a little bit of a questionnaire, looking at how people might view or perceive this whole scheme differently. When we offer different information to them. And this is a very interesting case to explore, because By connecting public perception or a policy issue to how the government might tell their stories differently. So essentially, we're trying to look at how the government makes decisions about storytelling. about publicity. Okay, so that's actually a slightly different approach. to… Data governance and policymaking. But again, if anyone who wants to pursue this project. We already did some preliminary work. Okay, so you won't start from scratch, which is always… Something good, something reassuring.

### Topic 5: Green Net Community Evaluation

**Simon Wang:** Hopping number 5? It's also related to, waste management. But this time, we are looking at a green ad community. Anyone aware of this? No joy, koi, koi koi. Green Net Community, okay? Now, again, In another course that I taught. Some students have done some work. And you can see there's a letter being published. On this topic. But the bottom line is that Based on… My students' research We believe that this screen and community project. It's a waste of money. Because if you consider the amount of money being spent. And the amount of solid waste being recycled. We can very hardly justify. The amount of money spent.

### Topic 7: Hong Kong Observatory Typhoon Signal Timing

**Simon Wang:** Okay? Topic number 7… is, not so popular topic. You know, anyone who picked this topic… actually, I was talking with a computer science student, Andy. he will probably work on this topic, but anyone who wants to join Andy, This is your opportunity. This topic came from a decision made by the Hong Kong Observatory last Monday. If you remember, if you recall, what happened last… Not last Monday, the… not yesterday, I mean, the… the Monday of the previous week. So, if you recall. The Hong Kong Observatory actually broke its tradition, or convention. Instead of announcing the decision to hoist the number 8 signal, like, 3 or 4 hours ago. they basically announced the decision around, like, 7 or 8 PM. And say, we are going to hoist the number 8 signal until… at least until 11 a.m. the next… the next day. So the Education Bureau actually announced that schools will be closed. Not in the morning. Not, like, 5 AM. But around 7 or 8 PM.

Now… If you look at the convention or prevailing guideline of the Hong Kong Observatory. They actually take a data-driven approach. They collect and monitor the wind Data, the wind speed data, from 30 different stations around the city. And they will only consider issuing signal number 8 when over half of the station. Gets the wind strength, or wind speed, Passing a threshold. Okay? So that's the conventional prevailing guideline. But… During the typhoon night, I was using the API, To monitor the wind data from the 30 stations, I found that not… over 15. Stations got the… passed the threshold. Actually, I built a website called Hong Kong Wind Monitor. And right now, the website is useless, because there's no special signal. But during the typhoon day, when number 8 is up, here it will show number 8. And then… Using the API, we are able to show the real-time wind speeds data from the 30 station. And you see how many of them reach Signal number 8. So, in other words. We're going to apply a data-driven approach to this specific case, and we're going to communicate with Hong Kong Observatory and ask them How can you possibly make the decision and prediction on the wind strength Like, 12 hours in advance. Okay? So, this would be a very interesting project as well. Of course, it might not be so popular, because people are very happy when they have an actual day off, right? I actually don't really have an actual day off. You know, when the number 8 signal was… was off, taken down around 1PM in the afternoon. You have to go to work and show up in 2 hours, at least that's what I did, you know, here at BU. So anyway, so that's, that's, number 7.

### Topic 6: Influenza Vaccination

**Simon Wang:** The last one… Oh, oh, actually, I haven't done… I haven't talked about number… number 6. Now, number 6 is about flu shot. It's about the influenza vaccination, okay? So it's a… it's a public health issue. Actually, many years ago, I published a couple of letters on this. So, 2018… 2017, so you see, it was years ago. Now, if you look at those letters. And, you can see that there's already some, some, some data. You know, there's already some data. quantitative information, but it's very basic, because at the time, I'm just doing VIN counting. I haven't been talking with… with math colleagues, with Talia, so… But now, with our math model. And our new, toolkit, we're going to take a look at this again.

### Topic 8: Open-Ended Exploration

**Simon Wang:** Alright. And finally, Topic number 8 If you are not interested in any of them, the previous 7 topics, if you find, oh, not so, Exciting. That's Andy. Andy, you wanna say hi? You only do the Typhoon one, right? Okay, so anyone who wants to do the typhoon one, you talk to Andy. Okay. Now… If you are not interested in any of them, There's an open-ended option. Okay? So, what you need to do is to go to… data.gov.hk. And just take any data set. And see whether you are able to connect the dataset with a specific policy or decision made by the government. And you go from there. Okay? So that's the last one. Oh, I didn't put a link here. Now, the good news about this data.gov.hk is that again, there's all the API available, The different, providers. Of, the dataset. Okay? Now, anyone who wants to pick number 8, It's going to be, very open-ended. So, you have to be patient, because… You have to do a little bit more exploration. And probably also a little bit of programming. Okay? But, again, I think there's a lot of possibilities there.

## Break and Transition to Math Models

**Simon Wang:** Great. So, any questions? So how about this? We have an early break, say, 5 minutes. We take a 5-minute break, so you guys can talk to one another, and maybe start forming groups, start looking at topics. And, once we… we're done. You know, hopefully you already got a team formed. or you can say hi to each other, you can reply here, you know, just take 5 minutes, and then Talia will start talking about math. Okay. Any questions? volcano. Okay. I think I should, share screen again. Supposed to share a screen.

## Recap of Week 2: Data Visualization

**Simon Wang:** Okay. The last time, we, do some basic data visualization with the help of GitHub Copilot, so I'll briefly recap. Usually, when we, try to visualize data, we will follow these steps. So, first of all, we need to load the dataset into our environment. And then we can have a basic understanding of what variables are contained in the dataset. Then use the correct way to visualize different types of data. For example, if we have categorical data, we usually use these bar charts, or pie charts. And for continuous data type, we will use the histogram, or this box whisker Plus, to see the distribution. And we can use scatterplots to see the relationship between two continuous random variables, and then save visualizations to a directory.

So last time, we used the, questionnaire data, for the, the, Municipal Solid Waste Data Questionnaire. So after we load the data, we usually have a look of what those, variables' names are. For example, the key variable in our dataset will be the support information. So one refers to strongly oppose the discharging scheme. Whereas 5 represents for the strong, support for the, charging scheme. So on and so forth. We have some variables recording the attitude of the public. Like, the preserved fairness of this policy, whether the government has good responsiveness to the public opinion while making this policy Whether this policy is helpful for reducing the waste. whether Hong Kong's waste management situation is severe or not. So this part is about the attitude towards this different aspect. Of this policy. And we also have other information, like where do the respondents leave. For each district, you know, there are 18 districts in Hong Kong, so for each district, we use a 0 or 1 variable to specify where this specific Respondent leaves. And we also record information like, what kind of, house type, or age, or some other demographic features of the, the respondents of the questionnaire.

To see the whole list of the variables measured, we can use this info So, info. Then here, lists all the pos… all the names of the variables. So, last time when we, do the warm-up exercise, some error is due to the wrong variable name. So, for example, here we have this fairness. But if later, when the co-pilot generates the code, it may use, say, perceived fairness, then that will lead to some error, because the variable name in our dataset is fairness, but not perceived fairness. So… Pay attention to these variable names and make sure that they are correctly cited in the later visualization part. Okay, so then we move to the, visualization, visualize the categorical data. So, first, The most, the variable that we care most is the support level, so we can first show the frequency table. See overall, how many people are, say, support or neutral, so on and so forth. Because it's categorical, it's usually easy to use this bar chart, We can see overall, Most people seems to be, support in general. We can also use this pie chart. But personally, I still prefer this bar chart, because I think human eyes are still more good at Judging the height of this bus,
