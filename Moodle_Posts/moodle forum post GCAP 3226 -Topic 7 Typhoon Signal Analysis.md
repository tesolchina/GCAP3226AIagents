# GCAP 3226 - Topic 7: Typhoon Signal Accuracy Analysis

**Course**: [[GCAP3226 01 Empowering Citizens through Data- Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong]]  
**Project Type**: Meteorological Policy and Data Analysis  
**Group Size**: 4-6 students

## Project Overview
Analyzing accuracy of Hong Kong Observatory's typhoon signal decisions by comparing actual wind data from 30 weather stations with No. 8 signal criteria to improve public safety and economic decision-making.

## Key Research Questions
- How accurately do typhoon signals reflect actual wind conditions?
- What factors beyond wind speed influence signal timing?
- How can signal accuracy and timing be improved?
- What are the economic and social impacts of signal timing decisions?

## Foundation Available
- HKO API access to 30 weather stations established
- Initial finding: Most measurements don't meet No. 8 criteria during signals
- Policy context of early announcements with time commitments
- Public safety and economic implications framework

## Project Deliverables
- Signal accuracy assessment
- Wind data comparison analysis
- Timing improvement recommendations
- Economic impact evaluation
