**Final Deliverable:** 2,500-3,000 word group research report
**Current Status:** Week 5 - Project Scoping & Planning

## Core Research Question
**Primary Question:** To what extent does the Hong Kong Observatory and emergency services use data-driven approaches in typhoon preparedness and emergency response planning?

**Specific Focus Areas:**
- Typhoon signal timing and decision-making processes
- Emergency response effectiveness and resource allocation
- Predictive modeling for risk assessment and early warning
- Community resilience and preparedness strategies

## Detailed Project Timeline (Weeks 5-13)

### Phase 1: Planning & Initial Data Collection (Weeks 5-7)

#### Week 5: Project Scoping & Planning (Current Week)
**Tasks:**
- Finalize research question and scope
- Assign team roles (see Section 3)
- Draft enquiry email to Hong Kong Observatory under Code on Access to Information
- Begin analysis of historical typhoon data

**Government Enquiry Template:**
> **Subject:** Request for Information under the Code on Access to Information: Typhoon Signal Timing and Emergency Response Data
> 
> **To:** Access to Information Officer, Hong Kong Observatory
> 
> **Dear Access to Information Officer,**
> 
> We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. As part of our final project, we are studying the decision-making processes related to typhoon signal timing and emergency response coordination.
> 
> Under the principles of the Code on Access to Information, we would be grateful if you could provide us with the following information:
> 
> 1. What specific quantitative data points (e.g., wind speed thresholds, rainfall measurements, historical patterns) are used to inform typhoon signal timing decisions?
> 2. Could you provide any public reports or policy documents that outline the standard operating procedures for typhoon signal issuance and emergency response coordination?
> 3. What data-driven criteria are used to evaluate the effectiveness of typhoon preparedness and emergency response strategies?

**Deliverable:** Submit one-page project plan and draft enquiry email to supervisors for feedback.

#### Week 6: Fieldwork & Primary Data Request (No Class)
**Tasks:**
- Send approved enquiry email to Hong Kong Observatory
- Begin intensive secondary data collection
- Conduct fieldwork at emergency shelters (with permission)
- Analyze historical typhoon impact data

**Actionable Instructions:**
- Search for weather and emergency data on data.gov.hk
- Collect historical typhoon records from Hong Kong Observatory
- Review emergency services response data
- Analyze damage assessment reports
- Create shared document to log all sources

**Deliverable:** Copy of sent email with timestamp and preliminary bibliography of at least 10 secondary sources.

#### Week 7: Data Consolidation & Model Selection
**Tasks:**
- Organize all collected secondary data
- Review any response from Hong Kong Observatory
- Decide on mathematical model (Regression or Simulation)

**Model Choice Justification:**
- **Choose Regression** if focusing on predicting typhoon impact severity based on meteorological data, historical patterns, or demographic factors
- **Choose Simulation** if modeling complex emergency response scenarios, evacuation planning, or resource allocation optimization

**Deliverable:** One-paragraph justification for model choice, submitted to Dr. Wu for approval.

### Phase 2: Modelling & Analysis (Weeks 8-10)

#### Weeks 8-9: Building "The Ideal" Scenario
**Tasks:**
- Develop mathematical model for optimal typhoon preparedness and emergency response
- Clean dataset and run model
- Document assumptions, variables, and methodology

**Regression Model Approach:**
- **Dependent Variable:** Typhoon impact severity, emergency response effectiveness, evacuation success rates
- **Independent Variables:** Wind speed, rainfall, population density, infrastructure quality, response time
- **Analysis:** Identify key factors affecting emergency response effectiveness

**Simulation Model Approach:**
- **System Definition:** Emergency response system with multiple components
- **Variables:** Population demographics, evacuation routes, shelter capacity, resource allocation, response timing
- **Scenarios:** Different emergency response strategies, resource allocation options, evacuation planning

**Deliverable:** Preliminary model results and draft methodology section.

#### Week 10: Synthesizing Reality & Ideal
**Tasks:**
- Compare current emergency response practices with model results
- Identify gaps between current approach and data-driven optimization
- Analyze potential consequences of current limitations

**Deliverable:** Bullet-point summary of comparative analysis.

### Phase 3: Reporting & Finalization (Weeks 11-13)

#### Week 11: Drafting Recommendations & Report Writing
**Tasks:**
- Formulate 3-5 concrete, evidence-based recommendations
- Each team member writes assigned section (~500 words each)
- Ensure recommendations address identified gaps

**Sample Recommendations:**
1. "Implement regression-based impact prediction models using meteorological data to improve typhoon signal timing and emergency response planning"
2. "Develop simulation models for evacuation planning to optimize resource allocation and response effectiveness"
3. "Establish data-driven criteria for emergency response evaluation and continuous improvement"

**Deliverable:** Complete first draft of entire group report.

#### Week 12: Peer Review, Editing & Consolidation
**Tasks:**
- Edit entire report for consistency, clarity, and tone
- Check grammar, citations, and formatting
- Ensure cohesive narrative flow

**Deliverable:** Near-final version of report, ready for final proofread.

#### Week 13: Final Submission
**Tasks:**
- Final proofread and submission
- Prepare presentation materials

**Deliverable:** 2,500-3,000 word group research report.
