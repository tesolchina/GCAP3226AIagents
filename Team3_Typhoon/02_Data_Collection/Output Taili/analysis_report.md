# Typhoon Taili (泰利) Wind Speed Analysis Report

## Analysis Period
- **Signal No. 8 Effective Period**: 2023-07-17 00:40 to 2023-07-17 16:20
- **Duration**: 15.7 hours

## HKO Signal No. 8 Criteria
According to Hong Kong Observatory guidelines:
- **Wind Speed Range**: 63-117 km/h (sustained winds)
- **Issuance Criterion**: Signal is issued when **half or more** (4 or more out of 8) reference anemometers register or are expected to register sustained winds within the prescribed range and the wind condition is expected to persist.

## 8 Reference Stations
1. **Ta Kwu Ling**
2. **Lau Fau Shan**
3. **Sha Tin**
4. **Tsing Yi**
5. **Kai Tak**
6. **Cheung Chau**
7. **Sai Kung**
8. **Chek Lap Kok**

### 2. Signal No. 8 Criterion Compliance

- **Maximum number of stations simultaneously exceeding 63 km/h**: 1 out of 8 stations
- **Times when 4+ stations met criterion**: 0 out of 95 time points (0.0%)
- **Peak wind speed recorded**: 87.0 km/h

### 3. Threshold Exceedance Summary

**Stations that never exceeded 63 km/h threshold**: Ta Kwu Ling, Lau Fau Shan, Sha Tin, Tsing Yi, Kai Tak, Sai Kung, Chek Lap Kok

## Visualizations Generated

1. **taili_8stations_wind_timeseries.png** - Time series showing wind speeds at all 8 stations over the Signal 8 period
2. **taili_8stations_timeseries.csv** - Pivoted CSV time series used for plotting and statistics

## Interpretation

This analysis summarizes measured wind speeds across the 8 reference anemometers during the Taili event and evaluates whether the HKO Signal No.8 issuance criteria were met based on the observed data.

## Data Source
Wind data collected from Hong Kong Observatory for the Taili event.
