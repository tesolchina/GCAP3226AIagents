# Hong Kong Observatory Email Draft v1 - Typhoon Signal Decision Analysis

**To:** Access to Information Officer, Hong Kong Observatory  
**Email:** mailbox@hko.gov.hk  
**Subject:** Request for Information under Code on Access to Information: Typhoon Signal Timing and Decision-Making Data  

**Dear Access to Information Officer,**

We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Empowering Citizens Through Data - Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong. We are conducting research on typhoon signal decision-making processes and emergency response coordination in Hong Kong.

## Research Context

Our research focuses on analyzing the relationship between signal announcement timing and decision accuracy, particularly examining how data-driven approaches can optimize typhoon signal timing decisions. This research is particularly relevant given recent concerns about signal timing decisions and their economic and safety implications.

## Data Requests

### 1. **Typhoon Signal Decision-Making Process**
- What specific quantitative data points (wind speed thresholds, rainfall measurements, historical patterns) are used to inform typhoon signal timing decisions?
- What is the standard operating procedure for typhoon signal issuance and emergency response coordination?
- How does the Observatory balance public safety considerations with economic impact when making signal timing decisions?

### 2. **Historical Signal Timing Data (2020-2024)**
- Signal announcement times and effective times for Signal 3 and Signal 8 events
- Wind speed measurements from the 8-station reference network during signal periods
- Comparison between predicted and actual wind conditions during signal periods
- Data on signal duration and accuracy for major typhoon events

### 3. **Decision-Making Criteria and Evaluation**
- What data-driven criteria are used to evaluate the effectiveness of typhoon signal decisions?
- How does the Observatory assess the accuracy of signal timing decisions?
- What mechanisms exist for evaluating and improving signal decision-making processes?

### 4. **Emergency Response Coordination Data**
- How does the Observatory coordinate with emergency services during typhoon events?
- What data is shared between the Observatory and other government departments?
- How is emergency response effectiveness measured and evaluated?

## Specific Research Questions

1. **Signal Timing Analysis**: How does the timing of signal announcements affect decision accuracy?
2. **Economic Impact Assessment**: What data is used to evaluate the economic consequences of signal decisions?
3. **Public Safety Optimization**: How are public safety requirements balanced with economic considerations?
4. **Decision-Making Process**: What factors beyond meteorological data influence signal timing decisions?

## Data Usage and Research Objectives

All requested data will be used exclusively for academic research to:
- Develop mathematical models for optimizing typhoon signal timing decisions
- Assess the relationship between signal announcement timing and decision accuracy
- Evaluate current data governance practices in typhoon signal decision-making
- Develop evidence-based recommendations for improving signal timing processes

## Research Methodology

Our research will employ:
- **Regression Analysis**: To analyze the relationship between signal timing and accuracy
- **Time Series Analysis**: To examine wind speed prediction accuracy
- **Simulation Modeling**: To test different signal timing strategies
- **Optimization Models**: To identify optimal signal timing approaches
