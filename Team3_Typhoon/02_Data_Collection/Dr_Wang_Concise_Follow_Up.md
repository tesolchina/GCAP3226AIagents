**Subject:** Follow-up: Typhoon Signal 8 Analysis - Data Verification Request (GCAP3226)  

**Dear Access to Information Officer,**

I am Dr. Simon Wang, course instructor for GCAP3226: Empowering Citizens Through Data at Hong Kong Baptist University. I am following up on my students' enquiry regarding typhoon signal decision-making analysis.

## Research Context

My students are conducting a final year project analyzing typhoon signal timing decisions, with particular focus on Signal 8 incidents. We have collected preliminary data and identified some interesting patterns that we would like to verify with official HKO data.

## Data Collection Request - Phased Approach

### **Phase 1: Most Recent Two Signal 8 Incidents**
We request comprehensive data for the **two most recent Signal 8 incidents**:

1. **Incident Details**: Announcement times, effective times, duration, decision rationale
2. **Wind Data (CSV)**: 10-minute interval measurements from all reference stations
3. **Decision Documentation**: Written rationale and timing justification

### **Phase 2: Extended Analysis** (if Phase 1 successful)
- Historical data for additional Signal 8 incidents
- Comparative analysis across multiple incidents

## Preliminary Data for Verification

We have collected real-time wind data and would like to verify our findings with official HKO data. **Attached CSV files** contain our preliminary analysis:

### **Data Files Available for Verification:**
