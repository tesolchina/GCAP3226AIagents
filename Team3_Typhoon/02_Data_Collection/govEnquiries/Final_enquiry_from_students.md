**Subject:** Request for Information: Typhoon Signal 8 Analysis Data (GCAP3226 Student Project) - Final Request  

**Dear Access to Information Officer,**

We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Empowering Citizens Through Data - Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong. We are conducting a course project analyzing typhoon signal decision-making processes, with particular focus on Signal 8 incidents.

## Course Project Context

Our project is part of our final year studies, supervised by Dr. Talia Wu (Mathematics) and Dr. Simon Wang (English). We are developing mathematical models to analyze signal timing decisions and their accuracy, particularly examining how Signal 8 decisions align with official criteria and real-time wind data.

## Research Objectives

Our project aims to:
- **Analyze Signal 8 Accuracy:** Compare official Signal 8 decisions with HKO criteria and real-time wind data
- **Examine Timing Impact:** Understand how announcement timing affects decision accuracy
- **Develop Mathematical Models:** Create frameworks for optimizing signal timing decisions
- **Provide Policy Recommendations:** Suggest improvements for Signal 8 decision-making processes

## Available Data Assessment

Based on our analysis of HKO open datasets, we have identified the following relevant data sources:

### **1. HKO Open Datasets (Available)**
