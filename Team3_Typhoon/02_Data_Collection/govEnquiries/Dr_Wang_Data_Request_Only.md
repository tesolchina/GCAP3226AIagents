## Typhoon Signal 8 Analysis - Government Data Request

**To:** Access to Information Officer, Hong Kong Observatory  
**Email:** mailbox@hko.gov.hk  
**Subject:** Request for Information: Typhoon Signal 8 Analysis Data (GCAP3226)  

**Dear Access to Information Officer,**

I am Dr. Simon Wang, course instructor for GCAP3226: Empowering Citizens Through Data at Hong Kong Baptist University. I am following up on my students' enquiry regarding typhoon signal decision-making analysis.

## Research Context

My students are conducting a final year project analyzing typhoon signal timing decisions, with particular focus on Signal 8 incidents. We are developing mathematical models to optimize signal timing decisions and improve emergency response coordination.

## Data Collection Request - Phased Approach

### **Phase 1: Most Recent Two Signal 8 Incidents**
We request comprehensive data for the **two most recent Signal 8 incidents**:

1. **Incident Details**: 
   - Signal 8 announcement times and effective times
   - Signal duration and lowering times
   - Official decision rationale and documentation

2. **Real-time Wind Data (CSV Format)**:
   - 10-minute interval wind speed measurements from all reference stations
   - Wind gust data for the same periods
   - Station-by-station breakdown during Signal 8 periods

3. **Decision-Making Documentation**:
   - Written rationale for Signal 8 decisions
   - Timing justification for announcements
   - Post-incident evaluation reports (if available)

### **Phase 2: Extended Analysis** (if Phase 1 successful)
- Historical data for additional Signal 8 incidents
- Comparative analysis across multiple incidents
- Long-term trend analysis

## Research Methodology

Our analysis employs rigorous academic methodology:

- **Regression Analysis**: Signal timing vs. accuracy relationships
- **Time Series Analysis**: Wind speed patterns and predictions
- **Statistical Analysis**: Cross-incident comparative analysis
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Optimization frameworks for decision-making
- **Data Governance Assessment**: Evaluation of current practices and recommendations

## Specific Research Questions

1. **Signal Timing Analysis**: How does the timing of Signal 8 announcements relate to actual wind conditions?
2. **Decision Criteria Consistency**: How consistently are the official criteria applied across different incidents?
3. **Decision Accuracy**: What factors contribute to accurate vs. inaccurate Signal 8 decisions?
4. **Economic Impact**: How do timing decisions affect economic and safety outcomes?

## Data Usage and Academic Standards

All requested data will be used exclusively for academic research to:
- **Develop Mathematical Models**: Create optimization frameworks for signal timing decisions
- **Assess Decision Accuracy**: Evaluate the relationship between announcement timing and actual conditions
- **Improve Emergency Response**: Optimize coordination between Observatory and emergency services
- **Policy Development**: Provide evidence-based recommendations for signal criteria

## Research Impact and Benefits

This research has the potential to:
- **Improve Decision-Making**: Develop mathematical models for better signal timing
- **Enhance Public Safety**: Optimize emergency response coordination
- **Academic Contribution**: Advance understanding of data-driven emergency management
- **Policy Development**: Provide evidence-based recommendations for signal criteria

## Timeline and Implementation

### **Phase 1 Timeline**:
- **Data Request**: Immediate (most recent two Signal 8 incidents)
- **Analysis Period**: 2-3 weeks for mathematical modeling
- **Report Completion**: November 2024

### **Phase 2 Timeline**:
- **Extended Data**: If Phase 1 successful, request additional historical data
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Full statistical analysis across multiple incidents
- **Final Report**: December 2024
