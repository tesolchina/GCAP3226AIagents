# Government Enquiry 02 - Hong Kong Observatory
## Focused Request for Signal 8 Incident Analysis

**To:** Access to Information Officer, Hong Kong Observatory  
**Email:** mailbox@hko.gov.hk  
**Subject:** Request for Information under Code on Access to Information: Signal 8 Incident Analysis and Decision Criteria  

**Dear Access to Information Officer,**

We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Empowering Citizens Through Data - Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong. We are conducting research on typhoon signal decision-making processes, with particular focus on Signal 8 incidents and their decision criteria.

## Research Context

Our research aims to analyze the relationship between signal announcement timing and decision accuracy, particularly examining the past 8 Signal 8 incidents to understand decision-making patterns and criteria application. This research is particularly relevant for improving typhoon preparedness and emergency response coordination.

## Specific Data Requests

### 1. **Past 8 Signal 8 Incidents - Historical Data**
We request comprehensive data for the past 8 Signal 8 incidents, including:

- **Incident Dates and Times**: 
  - Signal 8 announcement times
  - Signal 8 effective times  
  - Signal 8 duration
  - Date and time of signal lowering

- **Wind Speed Data (CSV Format)**:
  - Real-time wind speed measurements from all 8 reference anemometer stations
  - 10-minute interval data during each Signal 8 period
  - Wind gust measurements
  - Station-by-station breakdown for each incident

### 2. **Official Signal 8 Decision Criteria - Written Confirmation**
We request written confirmation of the current official criteria for hoisting Signal 8, including:

- **Wind Speed Thresholds**: Exact km/h requirements for Signal 8
- **Station Requirements**: Number of stations that must meet criteria
- **Duration Requirements**: How long conditions must persist
- **Decision-Making Process**: Step-by-step procedure for Signal 8 decisions
- **Reference Network**: Confirmation of the 8-station reference network locations

### 3. **Decision-Making Documentation**
For each of the past 8 Signal 8 incidents, we request:

- **Decision Rationale**: Written documentation of why Signal 8 was hoisted
- **Timing Justification**: Explanation of announcement timing decisions
- **Data Sources**: What meteorological data was used in the decision
- **Review Process**: Any post-incident evaluation or review documentation

### 4. **Data Format Specifications**
We specifically request:

- **CSV Data Files**: Real-time wind strength data in CSV format for analysis
- **Time Series Data**: 10-minute interval measurements during Signal 8 periods
- **Station Coordinates**: Geographic coordinates of all reference stations
- **Data Quality Indicators**: Any flags or notes about data reliability

## Research Objectives

This data will be used exclusively for academic research to:

- **Mathematical Modeling**: Develop regression models to analyze signal timing accuracy
- **Decision Analysis**: Evaluate the relationship between announcement timing and actual conditions
- **Criteria Assessment**: Analyze how consistently the official criteria are applied
- **Optimization Research**: Identify opportunities for improving signal timing decisions

## Specific Research Questions

1. **Timing Analysis**: How does the timing of Signal 8 announcements relate to actual wind conditions?
2. **Criteria Consistency**: How consistently are the official criteria applied across different incidents?
3. **Decision Accuracy**: What factors contribute to accurate vs. inaccurate Signal 8 decisions?
4. **Economic Impact**: How do timing decisions affect economic and safety outcomes?

## Data Usage and Methodology

Our research will employ:
- **Statistical Analysis**: Regression analysis of timing vs. accuracy relationships
- **Time Series Analysis**: Examination of wind speed patterns and predictions
- **Comparative Analysis**: Cross-incident analysis of decision-making patterns
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Development of optimization models for signal timing

## Contact Information

**Primary Contact:** [Team Leader Name]  
**Email:** [Team Email]  
**Institution:** Hong Kong Baptist University  
**Course:** GCAP3226 - Empowering Citizens Through Data  
**Supervisors:** Dr. Talia Wu (Mathematics), Dr. Simon Wang (English)

## Timeline and Follow-up

We would appreciate any available data by **November 9, 2024** to allow for proper analysis and report completion.

We are happy to:
- Provide additional clarification on our research objectives
- Sign confidentiality agreements if required
- Work within any data sharing protocols you may have
- Discuss alternative data formats if CSV is not available

## Academic Context

This research is part of our final year project focusing on data-driven government decision-making. The findings will contribute to academic understanding of emergency management and may provide insights for improving typhoon preparedness systems.

We are committed to using this data responsibly for academic research that can contribute to improving typhoon preparedness and emergency response in Hong Kong.

Thank you for your assistance in supporting our research on data-driven emergency management.

**Sincerely,**
