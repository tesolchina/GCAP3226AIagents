# Dr. Wang - Data Request v4
## Typhoon Signal 8 Analysis - Two Most Recent Incidents

**To:** Access to Information Officer, Hong Kong Observatory  
**Email:** mailbox@hko.gov.hk  
**Subject:** Request for Information: Typhoon Signal 8 Analysis Data (GCAP3226)  

**Dear Access to Information Officer,**

I am Dr. Simon Wang, course instructor for GCAP3226: Empowering Citizens Through Data at Hong Kong Baptist University. I am following up on my students' enquiry regarding typhoon signal decision-making analysis.

## Research Context

My students are conducting a course project analyzing typhoon signal timing decisions, with particular focus on Signal 8 incidents. We are developing mathematical models to analyze signal timing decisions and their accuracy.

## Data Request - Two Most Recent Signal 8 Incidents

We request comprehensive data for the **two most recent Signal 8 incidents**:

### **1. Incident Details**
- Signal 8 announcement times and effective times
- Signal duration and lowering times
- Official decision rationale and documentation

### **2. Real-time Wind Data (CSV Format)**
- 10-minute interval wind speed measurements from all reference stations
- Wind gust data for the same periods
- Station-by-station breakdown during Signal 8 periods

### **3. Decision-Making Documentation**
- Written rationale for Signal 8 decisions
- Timing justification for announcements
- Post-incident evaluation reports (if available)

## Research Methodology

Our analysis employs:
- **Regression Analysis**: Signal timing vs. accuracy relationships
- **Time Series Analysis**: Wind speed patterns and predictions
- **Statistical Analysis**: Cross-incident comparative analysis
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Optimization frameworks for decision-making

## Specific Research Questions

1. **Signal Timing Analysis**: How does the timing of Signal 8 announcements relate to actual wind conditions?
2. **Decision Criteria Consistency**: How consistently are the official criteria applied?
3. **Decision Accuracy**: What factors contribute to accurate vs. inaccurate Signal 8 decisions?

## Data Usage and Academic Standards

All requested data will be used exclusively for academic research to:
- **Develop Mathematical Models**: Create analysis frameworks for signal timing decisions
- **Assess Decision Accuracy**: Evaluate the relationship between announcement timing and actual conditions
- **Improve Understanding**: Better comprehension of signal decision-making processes
- **Policy Development**: Provide evidence-based recommendations for signal criteria

## Research Impact and Benefits

This research aims to:
- **Improve Decision-Making**: Develop mathematical models for better signal timing analysis
- **Enhance Understanding**: Better comprehension of signal decision-making processes
- **Academic Contribution**: Advance understanding of data-driven emergency management
- **Policy Development**: Provide evidence-based recommendations for signal criteria

## Timeline and Implementation

- **Data Request**: Immediate (two most recent Signal 8 incidents)
- **Analysis Period**: 2-3 weeks for mathematical modeling
- **Report Completion**: November 2024
