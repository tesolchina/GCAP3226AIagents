# Follow-up Email from Dr. Simon Wang - Course Instructor
## Clarification and Phased Data Collection Request

**To:** Access to Information Officer, Hong Kong Observatory  
**Email:** mailbox@hko.gov.hk  
**Subject:** Follow-up: Request for Information - Typhoon Signal 8 Analysis (GCAP3226 Course Project)  

**Dear Access to Information Officer,**

I am writing as the course instructor for GCAP3226: Empowering Citizens Through Data - Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong at Hong Kong Baptist University. I would like to follow up on the enquiry submitted by my students regarding typhoon signal decision-making analysis.

## Course Context and Research Objectives

This is a final year undergraduate course where students conduct data-driven policy analysis projects. The typhoon signal analysis project aims to develop mathematical models for optimizing signal timing decisions and improving emergency response coordination.

## Clarification of Data Requirements

To better focus our research, I would like to clarify and prioritize our data collection needs:

### **Phase 1: Priority Data (Most Recent Two Signal 8 Incidents)**
We request comprehensive data for the **two most recent Signal 8 incidents**, including:

1. **Incident Details**:
   - Signal 8 announcement times and effective times
   - Signal duration and lowering times
   - Official decision rationale and documentation

2. **Real-time Wind Data (CSV Format)**:
   - 10-minute interval wind speed measurements from all reference stations
   - Wind gust data for the same periods
   - Station-by-station breakdown during Signal 8 periods

3. **Decision-Making Documentation**:
   - Written rationale for Signal 8 decisions
   - Timing justification for announcements
   - Post-incident evaluation reports (if available)

### **Phase 2: Extended Analysis (If Phase 1 Successful)**
If the initial data proves valuable for our research, we would like to request:
- Historical data for additional Signal 8 incidents
- Comparative analysis across multiple incidents
- Long-term trend analysis

## Data Verification and Cross-Reference

We have been conducting preliminary analysis using publicly available HKO data and have identified some interesting patterns that we would like to verify with official data. Specifically:

### **Our Preliminary Findings**:
- We have collected real-time wind data from 30 weather stations
- Our analysis shows some discrepancies between calculated signals and official signals
- We have identified potential timing issues in recent Signal 8 decisions

### **Data for Verification**:
We have CSV data files from our preliminary analysis that we can share for verification:
- **Data Collection Period**: September 2025 (ongoing)
- **Data Format**: CSV files with 10-minute interval measurements
- **Coverage**: 30 weather stations across Hong Kong
- **Verification Status**: 96.7% station accuracy rate

### **Specific Verification Requests**:
1. **Signal Timing Accuracy**: How do our calculated signals compare with official HKO signals?
2. **Decision Criteria Application**: Are the official criteria consistently applied?
3. **Timing Analysis**: What factors influence the timing of Signal 8 announcements?

## Research Methodology and Academic Standards

Our research employs rigorous academic methodology:

### **Mathematical Models**:
- **Regression Analysis**: Relationship between signal timing and accuracy
- **Time Series Analysis**: Wind speed prediction and pattern recognition
- **Optimization Models**: Development of improved decision-making frameworks
- **Statistical Analysis**: Cross-incident comparative analysis

### **Data Governance Framework**:
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Evaluation of data collection and accuracy
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Understanding decision-making processes
- **Policy Evaluation**: Assessment of current practices and recommendations

## Academic Collaboration and Data Sharing

We are committed to responsible data use and academic collaboration:

### **Data Usage**:
- **Academic Research Only**: All data used exclusively for course project
- **Confidentiality**: Willing to sign confidentiality agreements if required
- **Data Protection**: Committed to protecting sensitive information

- **Methodology Review**: Invite HKO input on our analytical approaches
- **Research Feedback**: Provide research findings that may benefit HKO operations

## Timeline and Implementation

### **Phase 1 Timeline**:
- **Data Request**: Immediate (most recent two Signal 8 incidents)
- **Analysis Period**: 2-3 weeks for mathematical modeling
- **Report Completion**: November 2024

### **Phase 2 Timeline**:
- **Extended Data**: If Phase 1 successful, request additional historical data
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Full statistical analysis across multiple incidents
- **Final Report**: December 2024
