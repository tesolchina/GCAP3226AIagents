Dear HKO staff

 Many thanks for your response to my students' enquiries. To clarify we're looking for the real time data of wind strength during the time when signal no 8 signals were hoisted. Please confirm such data could be retrieved via the links you provided earlier. Such data were available via API; just wonder if CSV files of the historical data can be found.

In addition, could you also let us know HKO team's principles and criteria for hoisting signal no. 3 and no 8? Based on our analysis of the real time data from API, it seems that the wind data did not meet the criteria established. If this is the case, could your team disclose any reports on such discrepancies and offer explanations on how signal no 8 and no 3 were justified when the real time wind strength data may not exceed the thresholds.

Hope my questions are clear; Thanks in advance for your help.

Yours sincerely

Simon Wang
