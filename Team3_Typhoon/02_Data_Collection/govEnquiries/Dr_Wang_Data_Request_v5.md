## Typhoon Signal 8 Analysis - Student Data Request

**To:** Access to Information Officer, Hong Kong Observatory  
**Email:** mailbox@hko.gov.hk  
**Subject:** Request for Information: Typhoon Signal 8 Analysis Data (GCAP3226 Student Project)  

**Dear Access to Information Officer,**

We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Empowering Citizens Through Data - Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong. We are conducting a course project analyzing typhoon signal decision-making processes, with particular focus on Signal 8 incidents.

## Course Project Context

Our project is part of our final year studies, supervised by Dr. Talia Wu (Mathematics) and Dr. Simon Wang (English). We are developing mathematical models to analyze signal timing decisions and their accuracy, particularly examining how Signal 8 decisions align with official criteria and real-time wind data.

## Research Objectives

Our project aims to:
- **Analyze Signal 8 Accuracy:** Compare official Signal 8 decisions with HKO criteria and real-time wind data
- **Examine Timing Impact:** Understand how announcement timing affects decision accuracy
- **Develop Mathematical Models:** Create frameworks for optimizing signal timing decisions
- **Provide Policy Recommendations:** Suggest improvements for Signal 8 decision-making processes

## Data Request - Two Most Recent Signal 8 Incidents

We request comprehensive data for the **two most recent Signal 8 incidents** to support our academic research:

### **1. Incident Details**
- Signal 8 announcement times and effective times
- Signal duration and lowering times
- Official decision rationale and documentation
- Any post-incident evaluation reports

### **2. Real-time Wind Data (CSV Format)**
- 10-minute interval wind speed measurements from all reference stations
- Wind gust data for the same periods
- Station-by-station breakdown during Signal 8 periods
- Data from the 8-station reference network

### **3. Decision-Making Documentation**
- Written rationale for Signal 8 decisions
- Timing justification for announcements
- Criteria used in decision-making process
- Any internal evaluation or review documentation

## Research Methodology

Our analysis will employ:
- **Statistical Analysis:** Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis of Signal 8 decisions
- **Mathematical Modeling:** Regression analysis to understand timing-accuracy relationships
- **Comparative Analysis:** Cross-incident evaluation of decision patterns
- **Accuracy Assessment:** Comparison of decisions with official criteria and real-time data

## Specific Research Questions

1. **Signal Timing Analysis:** How does the timing of Signal 8 announcements relate to actual wind conditions?
2. **Decision Criteria Consistency:** How consistently are the official criteria applied across different incidents?
