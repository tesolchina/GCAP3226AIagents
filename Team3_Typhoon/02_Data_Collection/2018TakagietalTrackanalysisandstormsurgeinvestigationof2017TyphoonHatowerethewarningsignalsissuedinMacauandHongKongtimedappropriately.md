trajectories and made landfall in the Pearl River Delta in the last few decades. Although Hato
was not the strongest of these storms, its forward speed of about 32.5km/h was remarkably
faster than those of other comparable typhoons. Higher levels of storm signal warnings were
issued earlier in Hong Kong than in Macau, raising questions about the appropriate timing of
warnings in these two nearby areas. Our analysis of the storm’s pattern suggests that both
regions’ decisions regarding signal issuance could be considered reasonable or at least cannot
be simply blamed, given the rapid motion and intensification of Hato and the associated

Macau and Hong Kong use analogous warning systems
based on sustained winds or gusts (Table A1), whereas
mainland China uses a different warning system (pro-

5. Conclusions
Our study demonstrated that Typhoon Hato caused
unprecedented storm surges of 2–3m in Macau and
Hong Kong, although human losses were relatively
minor given the extent of inundation in these regions.
Significant wave overtopping and runup also occurred
on beaches and in ports. While our analysis suggests
