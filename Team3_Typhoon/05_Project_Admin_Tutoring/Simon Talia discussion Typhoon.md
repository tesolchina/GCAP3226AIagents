Yeah, so I think the typhoon case, the decision is really about, I think the decision is when the observatory should make the announcement or the decisions to about the signal number eight, right? Because that timing can make a world of difference. And sometimes, if we look at the more recent cases, the two recent number eight cases, the staff, the government staff, started to make an announcement earlier than the typical practice in the past. And one of the consequences of that could be simply that the announced decision is not made based on the latest wind data. Right? So the alternative reality would be if the observatory staff wait until maybe five hours later to make that decision, because, because usually people make decisions at 4am or 5am on whether to hoist the number eight signal. So if it's closer, they got much more data, maybe the decision will be different. But then, when we look at the real empirical data, we see that even though the number eight signal was was hoisted, but but the real data seems to indicate that the wind data, the wind strength does not really meet the threshold for number eight. So, so that seems to be a real concern, because when the number eight is hoisted, there will be real economic consequences for the whole economy, for the whole city. Of course, nowadays we have the stock market still running, but then everyone else will have to stay at home, right? So the businesses will lose one day of Operation generating revenue. And there could be people who get paid on an hourly basis, they're going to lose some income. So there are real consequences for making premature decisions, right? And we need to basically ask the staff to explain. And also, if you look at the real data. If it turns out that it is a premature decision, then I think they have to re review and look at the decision making processes, because apparently they are deviating from the more conventional, time tested practices of making last minute decision. And of course, there's convenience of doing that right because, because everybody wants certainty, it's better even 48 hours in advance, or what a month in advance is that, I mean, but, but you don't have that kind of predictive model to make the accurate decision, the accurate prediction, yeah, I

Talia Wu  
think it's a complicated decision. It's a trade off between the public safety and the economy. It's hard to measure the value of safety, I think so. I think as a department of government, they tend to make more conservative decision.

Simon H WANG  
That's right. But, but see, the thing is, if you look at the actual reality, but of course, host, you know, whatever evaluation, for example, if we look at, of course, I mean, Wednesday is definitely very strong case for number eight or even number 10. But Tuesday, you know, if you look at Tuesday, the education Bureau made the announcement well in advance to cancel the schools, right? But, but in retrospect, that day is a perfect day for for schooling for everybody. So I don't know what is the foundation, or what is the ground or evidence or data that the government would use to justify hoisting number eight at 2pm or whatever is that me, and also for education Bureau too, because of that decision to cancel the classes for everybody, every school children.

Talia Wu  
I think we can ask the decision making process for for this announcement, but regarding the mass model, I think I do not have the ability to predict the wind spreads,

Simon H WANG  
Because what if we consider the decision of when to hoist number eight, or the decision to cancel a day's class or have a having a day off as the kind of The, I don't know the independent variable or dependent variable, right? But then there's a different factors that could contribute or affect that that variable, right? And Wang data could be one of them. But then there could be other other consideration, right? Because, because, I think we should have some kind of mechanism to assess to what extent a particular decision is reasonable, as you mentioned, there could be risk management. It's about protection, right? Protecting the vulnerable groups. That's why school children stay indoor. And there's also the protection of of people, the public in general, right, right, if you have to commute, if you have to travel and work on that day, and if it's a bad day and there will be risk of casualty or damage. But then there's actually data of tree falling. There's data of, you know, people getting hurt on a particular day, so that could become the data to justify a decision of staying indoor. And so one thing we could do is to look at the past 10 incidents of number eight, and to see, during those time when number eight was hoisted, how many damages reports were, how many damage cases were reported, how many, how many people got hurt, right? And that could be another objective way to assess the severity of an extreme weather or natural disaster, because at the end of the day, it's not just about data. It's about people's perception as well, when you hoist number eight, but then the whole day is perfect. There's no wind or not much wind, people will start questioning. It's a trust issue. I think H O needs to maintain its trustworthiness by making professional decisions. And apparently, as I said, you know, Tuesday number eight, it's, it's highly questionable. Of course, people enjoy a day off or have day off but, but that's, that's not, that's not a serious reasoning. There will be consequences of this kind of of decisions.

So any any other model or possibility of analysis I

Talia Wu  
the public understanding of Signal Number eight is generally high. Commensating associated risks and recommended safety measures, however, actual preparedness behavior, such as

Simon H WANG  
assembling evacuation kits for avoiding risky we are influenced

Talia Wu  
by factors effectiveness and challenges. These include ensuring vulnerable

Simon H WANG  
populations, yeah, actually, some of the literature could be very useful for my students working on the Emergency Alert System, there's one team picking up this topic again. The funny thing is, a while ago, there was a lawmaker asking the government which department or Bureau can trigger issuing an emergency alert, and then the government stopped saying, basically saying any department and Bureau could do that. So what are we going to do? Is going to send a mass email using Mail Merge to ask each, each department and Bureau whether you have a team to prepare this kind of emergency alert. Because presumably, if, if that, that that government is person is saying the telling the truth, then each department and bureau should have a team ready. You know, just in case there's an emergency happened within their domain, within their their responses, scope or something, they should, they should is ready to issue alert, because that can be a very serious thing, right? So we asked them whether there's a team, because, because they they refuse to tell us which department of Bureau are actually issuing this kind of alert. Then we will start collecting some some info from so what we'll see how they respond whether There's a team to actually do that. But yeah, I

Talia Wu  
Wang, how do fundamental models enhance that almost fear science research on planets can

I think the typhoon group should send their request or inquiry to the hKo first ask The existing decision making process how they balance the public safety and economy,

except for the prediction of the wind strengths based on their model. So I believe their decision must have different aspects. So, from the aspects of public safety, from the perspective of economy, many other things in addition to that, predictive wind strength, which is objective, objective prediction. There must be other concerns. So how do they balance all these different factors? But do you think they will tell us how exactly this will happen, or just by majority voting, like they had nine, seven people in the room, and if four people decide we need to hoist

Simon H WANG  
I can imagine they can definitely give us a non answer reply. So they can they can make all kinds of general statement without offering any substance or real insights into the decision making process, it's very easy to give that kind of process, which is why we have to consider how we frame the questions, because sometimes if We raise certain question, like a yes, no question, if even a no could could mean could give us some insights into the process. So so it really depends on how we how we frame our questions, and exactly what we we want to know, but sometimes the data itself can be quite revealing, right? Because if, if you just look at the wind data during the time when the number eight is is effective in the past, I don't know, five or 10 incidents, and also that, compare that with the time when they make the decision or or timing. So I don't know. Could that be a regression?

Regress, regress, what onward, like the timing of the decision and and the extent to which the real ring win data would meet the number eight or the accuracy of that decision. But it could be a categorical it could be a categorical variable, right? Or it could be the timing. Timing could be continuous. Say, the

Talia Wu  
effect time is like, 2pm

Simon H WANG  
say, So, what's the so? So, for example, 2pm to hoist the number eight. It could be, the decision could be, the announcement could be made two hours in advance, or five hours in advance, or 12 hours in advance, so that that hours, number of hours, could be affecting the accuracy of of the signal. Accuracy can be measured by looking at the real wing data during the effective time of the signal.

Talia Wu  
You mean, the shorter the time interval between the two, the more accuracy the result. Yeah. How to measure the accuracy

Simon H WANG  
we have the real time wind data. And they have a they have a criteria. I think the latest criteria is they only look at eight stations, and half of them would reach certain threshold,

Talia Wu  
yeah, but that is time series, you know, for because time is passing, and with different time points, the level of the wind strengths are different. So for there are, say, many stations, and maybe we have data for every 10 minutes. So for the station one, for this time, we have a actual observation of the wind strength, right then, what is the what is the real one? What is the true so can we, well, do you mean we compare this with the direction holder of signal number eight? And yeah, if the How about the other? How about the other stations? Do we take an average for this eight stations as at this time point the overall true wind stress, and compare it with the threshold of signal number eight. And then how about the other time point? We have many, many, many, right?

Simon H WANG  
But the thing is, the number eight was effective in a given period of time. We know that, right? So, so we can potentially look at each data point during that time span, and at each data point each each point in time, we can check whether the threshold is met, because where the threshold is met is a categorical variable is true or false, right? So, so at at each point in time, we can, we can see how many stations get the wind data, or wind strength that's over the threshold.

Talia Wu  
I think this is a relatively less informative way to capture the value of the wind stress, say at this is the station one, station two, station three, we're using some numerical value to minus the threshold of wind speed at this signal number eight. So that will be a numerical value for each station. What we have is a numerical value. Maybe for some stations, the value is positive, and for others is negative, but they are numerical. So it's not just a zero or one meets the criteria or not the value

Simon H WANG  
because relative to the threshold, right? Yeah, the longer the value is greater severe severity

Talia Wu  
deviation from the threshold. Okay, so the the number itself is more informative, okay, this meat or not, right? We can say within this 10 hours of hoisting this number eight for each hour, we calculate, on average, how much deviation do we have of the empirical data to the threshold, and then, for each hour we have one then, then, how We make use of this? Like, how many hours in advance say,

Simon H WANG  
Well, I think what we should be concerned about is not the whole duration of number eight. What we should be concerned about is the is the threshold. Is the point when number three turn to number eight, I think the timing matters. For example, they they decide 2pm to to turn to number eight. So the wind data around that time, or probably two hours into that that number eight would be more relevant than the rest of the time. Because what we're concerned is, what is the right timing of announcing number eight? Is that me if, if the data around that time, say two hours or three hours was much weaker, the wind data suggests that it's actually not reaching number eight at all, then we should consider maybe, of course, in retrospect, maybe that decision to to host to hoist number eight should be postponed to two or three hours later. It could be, but that that would be a real, real difference for the whole city.

Talia Wu  
I think the way the observatory make prediction will be different from ours. They may use some dynamic system, something to have a prediction that at 2pm the wind will be reaching this threshold. That's the reason they I don't know, I don't know how. I don't know how they how they actually do the I A

I'm not sure whether they calculated probability like the probability that at 2pm the probability that the wind speed will be greater than the threshold will be greater than 50% so percent. If that if they predict the probability is greater than 50%. And then they decide for this time point, they will hoist. Up.

Simon H WANG  
But whether we are looking at whether we are looking at the this decision as a categorical I mean, I mean assessing the accuracy of the decision, looking at whether passing a threshold, or we look at the absolute value that that's something that's debatable, but, but I would say we should definitely assign more weights to the data that's near the or around the time of the decision, because now maybe our concern is not so much as whether number eight should be hoisted at all, but rather the timing, and the timing makes a whole world of difference as the timing of the announcement, and also the timing of the actual effective because, because, I think the staff have the incentive to enlarge that, that gap between when to make the decision or when to Make an announcement and when to actually hoist the signal, but based on intuition, the shorter that gap, of

Talia Wu  
course, yeah, the more likelihood

Simon H WANG  
that they will be more accurate. Yeah. Then, then I think whoever decided to make a bigger gap between for this, they need to justify their decisions. If our analysis indicates that, or our analysis established, there is a strong relationship between the timing when to make the announcement and the actual accuracy as the decision. I think this is,

Talia Wu  
this is this should be obvious, because for every time series with the long with the so this is no to the future if we want to make prediction, the longer the time interval between the future time point to now, the larger variance the predicted value we will have. This is a I think this is a common sense. But I think what you mentioned is that the question is, how they decide to announce about the timing to hoist the signal, right.

Simon H WANG  
Okay, you.
