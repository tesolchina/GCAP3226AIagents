# Mathematical Models for Typhoon Signal Analysis

## Regression Analysis
- **Linear Regression**: Predict typhoon signal timing using meteorological variables (wind speed, pressure, rainfall)
- **Logistic Regression**: Model signal escalation decisions (T1→T3→T8→T9→T10) based on weather conditions
- **Time Series Regression**: Analyze signal duration and frequency patterns over typhoon seasons
- **Multiple Regression**: Evaluate factors affecting signal accuracy (forecast accuracy, historical data, public safety)
- **Survival Analysis**: Model time-to-signal-change based on typhoon intensity and trajectory

## Simulation Models
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Model typhoon path uncertainty and signal decision outcomes
- **Weather Simulation**: Simulate typhoon development and intensity changes
- **Decision Tree Simulation**: Model signal escalation logic under different weather scenarios
- **Impact Simulation**: Model economic and social impacts of different signal timing decisions
- **Risk Assessment Simulation**: Evaluate signal accuracy and false positive/negative rates

## Data Requirements
- **For Regression**: Historical typhoon data, signal records, meteorological data, economic impact data
- **For Simulation**: Real-time weather data, typhoon tracking data, signal decision logs, impact assessments
