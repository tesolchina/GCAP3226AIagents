# Mathematical Models for Solid Waste Charging Analysis

## Regression Analysis
- **Linear Regression**: Predict waste generation using demographic and economic variables (income, household size, consumption patterns)
- **Logistic Regression**: Model compliance behavior (pay/not pay) based on charging scheme characteristics
- **Multiple Regression**: Analyze factors affecting waste reduction (pricing, awareness, enforcement)
- **Time Series Regression**: Track waste generation trends before and after charging implementation
- **Spatial Regression**: Model waste generation patterns by district and socioeconomic factors

## Simulation Models
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Model waste generation variability and charging scheme effectiveness
- **Agent-Based Simulation**: Simulate household waste reduction behavior under different charging scenarios
- **Economic Simulation**: Model cost-benefit analysis of different charging schemes and enforcement levels
- **Behavioral Simulation**: Test household response to different pricing structures and incentives
- **Policy Impact Simulation**: Evaluate long-term effects of charging schemes on waste reduction and compliance

## Data Requirements
- **For Regression**: Historical waste data, demographic statistics, economic indicators, charging scheme records
- **For Simulation**: Household consumption data, waste generation patterns, pricing data, compliance records, enforcement data
