## Best Practices

### Slide Design Tips
- **Keep it Simple:** 5-7 bullet points maximum per slide
- **Visual First:** Use charts, graphs, images to convey information
- **Large Text:** Minimum 24pt font for readability when screen sharing
- **Consistent Style:** Use consistent colors, fonts, and formatting
- **One Idea per Slide:** Each slide should make one clear point

### Delivery Tips
- **Practice Together:** Rehearse as a team at least twice
- **Time Each Section:** Ensure each speaker knows their time limit
- **Smooth Transitions:** Use phrases like "I'll now hand over to [Name] to discuss..."
- **Eye Contact:** Look at camera (even if camera is off, speaking directly helps clarity)
- **Pace Yourself:** Speak clearly and at moderate pace; pause for emphasis

### Content Tips
- **Tell a Story:** Structure as narrative (problem → approach → findings → implications)
- **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Use concrete examples and data visualizations
- **Be Honest:** Acknowledge limitations and challenges openly
- **Think Like Stakeholders:** What would District Council/LegCo members want to know?

### Technical Tips
- **Test Equipment:** Check microphone, screen sharing, and internet connection beforehand
- **Backup Plan:** Have slides downloaded locally in case of internet issues
- **Quiet Environment:** Present from quiet location with good internet
- **Close Apps:** Close unnecessary applications to avoid distractions

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can we use AI tools to create slides?
**A:** Yes, AI tools are encouraged for slide creation, but content must be original work. Clearly cite any AI-generated visualizations or content.

### Q: What if a team member cannot present?
**A:** Contact instructors immediately. Team members may need to cover additional sections or arrange alternative timing. All members should participate.

### Q: Can we go over 8 minutes if we have important content?
**A:** No. Time management is part of the assessment. Practice to fit within 8 minutes. Focus on most important points.

### Q: Should we prepare handouts?
**A:** Not required for presentations, but you may prepare a one-page summary for stakeholders (Week 13 presentation) if helpful.

### Q: How detailed should technical methodology be?
**A:** Explain methodology clearly but focus on results and implications. Use visualizations to illustrate technical concepts. Assume mixed audience (stakeholders may not have technical background).

### Q: What if government/stakeholder data isn't received yet?
**A:** Discuss what data was requested, alternative sources used, preliminary analysis with available data, and how pending data will be incorporated.
