Simon Wang: Test time.

Simon Wang: Bye.

Simon Wang: You guys are kind of galapenos.

Simon Wang: Interesting.

Simon Wang: No problem.

Simon Wang: I don't know.

Simon Wang: What the heck?

Simon Wang: Oh, goodness.

Simon Wang: Go ahead and start the team.

Simon Wang: Good morning, we, discussed about the typhoon Signal Data Analysis.

Simon Wang: use our content.

Simon Wang: Recently, there are earlier announcements than traditional practices when Typhoon was in ruins in Hong Kong, such as Waihu Nagasa in this year. Signal X was hosted at 2.20pm, despite our only…

Simon Wang: 3 out of the stations showing 63 within the final 10 minutes interval. HKO states that it is forecasting elements and precautionary alerts.

Simon Wang: Signal 8 decisions have significant economic consequences for the city.

Simon Wang: HKEX operates normally during signal age, so start over…

Simon Wang: Yeah, so in 5P constantly alerts.

Simon Wang: Economic loss from shutdowns and disruption from school suspensions.

Simon Wang: Our main research question is, do signal age decisions align with real-time wind data and official criteria? And what factors contribute to discrepancies?

Simon Wang: Our sub-question, followed by the time research question, is…

Simon Wang: To generate an assumption, we analyzed with official HKO criteria based on real-time data.

Simon Wang: What these supremises exist between real-time wind strength and signal aid decisions? How transparent the HKO's criteria and decision-making processes?

Simon Wang: What first practice contribute to accurate versus inaccurate Signal 8 decisions? How can data-driven analysis improve a signal-8 decision accuracy?

Simon Wang: Our primary objective is necessary for transparency in decision-making process, and therefore secondary alternatives.

Simon Wang: Now, I will briefly cover the academic foundation of our project. Our research shows that issuing a signal A is not just about wind speed. We identified three key theories that guide our analysis. First is the precautionary principle. Explain why HKO might act early to manage risk.

Simon Wang: Second is the transparency and accountability theory, highlights that why a clear process is crucial for public trust. And third is the stakeholder theory shows it is a constant balancing act between public

Simon Wang: safety, economic, and daily lives. So…

Simon Wang: How do we objectively make sure accuracy? We use HKO's own ruler, the official standard.

Simon Wang: First, the wind requirement. The sustained wind speed must reach between 63 to 107 kilometers per hour. Second, the location requirement. The HKO uses a specific network of 8 reference stations, which you can see on the map.

Simon Wang: And third, and the most important, is the golden rule to issue a signal A, 4 of…

Simon Wang: 4 or above of this aid station must be expected to record 63 to 107 kilometer wind speed.

Simon Wang: This brings us to the most important question, why does our research matter? If we look at the current situation, most debates about signal accuracy are based on qualitative discussion, or just focusing on

Simon Wang: isolated single case study of one typhoon at a time. This reveals a critical gap. Why missing is… what missing is…

Simon Wang: systematic, data-driven validation that looks across multiple typhoons to see if the rules are actually met.

Simon Wang: And that is our contribution. We provide a cognitive

Simon Wang: and evidence-based analysis. We will build a framework that can

Simon Wang: assess multiple typhoons, giving us the bigger picture. Automatically, our goal is to conduct a truly comprehensive data-driven accuracy assessment of signal A decision.

Simon Wang: In this session, I will explain the methodology and the data collection process for assessing Typhoon signal decisions, particularly signal number 8 in Hong Kong.

Simon Wang: Our goal is to evaluate both the technical accuracy and the governance transparency behind these decisions. We use a mixed methods approach, combining quantitative… quantitative logical analysis.

Simon Wang: with qualitative policy evaluation. And why mixed methods? Because Typhoon Signal decisions are not just technical, they involve governance and public communication. The framework includes data-driven analysis of wind patterns.

Simon Wang: Comparative evaluation across multiple typhoon events. Policy assessment for transparency and accountability.

Simon Wang: Our data source falls into three main categories. Real-time wind data from Hong Kong Observatory APIs.

Simon Wang: Historical signal number 8 records spanning 37 years. Governance… government documentation and inquiry response for policy evaluation.

Simon Wang: For real-time data, we integrate Hong Kong Observatory API to collect wind speed, direction, and gas measurements from multiple stations.

Simon Wang: Data is captured at 10-minute intervals during signal numeric periods. Validation is done by cross-referencing multiple sources and applying calibration to ensure accuracy.

Simon Wang: We're also going to use historical data sets, and it includes 37 years of tropical cycling impact data from 1988 to 2025.

Simon Wang: Best track data.

Simon Wang: Or typhoon trajectories and wind patterns.

Simon Wang: A visual governance criteria for signal decisions.

Simon Wang: And this helps us identify long-term trends and consistency in decision making.

Simon Wang: For government inquiry data, we will analyze official responses to data requests and published criteria. This qualitative component helps us assess transparency, decision rationale, and accountability.

Simon Wang: Beyond meteorological data, we include signal decision documentation, Timestamps and advisory notes.

Simon Wang: And then… Emergency response data, which is a resource deployment and response times, and then integration issues.

Simon Wang: gaps in data sharing between Hong Kong observatory and Emergency Services. And for data analysis framework, analysis uses statistical methods.

Simon Wang: Which includes, descriptive, stats, correlation, regression.

Simon Wang: And then, mathematical models.

Simon Wang: Which is, accuracy measurement, timing, optimization, predictive modeling, Animals the analysis?

Simon Wang: We will do a transparency assessment, stakeholder impact, and recommendations.

Simon Wang: To ensure reliability, we validate data across multiple sources, apply quality control checks for anomalies, maintain comprehensive documents of all process, and current limitation we have, includes missing public response data.

Simon Wang: Restricted access to internal decision-making records?

Simon Wang: Fragmented data system.

Simon Wang: And then our future improvements should focus on integrated platforms for real-time data, AI-driven predictive models.

Simon Wang: public-facing dashboard for transparency, and in summary, this methodology ensures a robust evaluation of both technical and governance aspects of typhoon signal decisions.

Simon Wang: So, after we talk about how we collect data, so let's talk about how we analyze and get results from them. Before we start, can you guys take out the phone and open the QR code scanner? Later, we're gonna use it.

Simon Wang: So… actually, HKO adheres to the forecast-based rule, which is 4 out of 8 or more stations detect wind speed above 63 kilometers, and our algorithm actually tries to replicate that, so we can see if HKO is really following the standard they claim they're following to when issuing signal 8.

Simon Wang: So, we analyzed the wind speed between 63 kilometers and 117, which is the T8 compliance, and only TALIM fully met observed persistence with two periods, and others are mainly forecast-driven.

Simon Wang: And the timing analysis shows that the official lead time is around 3 to 6 hours, which means HKOE usually issue Typhoon Signal 8 about 3 to 6 hours in advance before the typhoon actually reached signal number 8, which gives the public more time to take actions.

Simon Wang: And during our research, we actually found that the factors are actually beyond wind.

Simon Wang: We actually… they actually include persistent spatial heterogeneity, human judgment, and transparency gaps in public process and understanding.

Simon Wang: So, here's where you're gonna… you're gonna scan the code. So, this is the website we built to…

Simon Wang: Visualize the data, and it's still under development, so it takes around… it takes a few seconds to load, so please be patient when you guys are playing around it.

Simon Wang: And in case you guys don't have laptop or phone to show the website, here are some graphics that we capture from the website. So, as you guys can see, the red part here, you can see the red background.

Simon Wang: these are actually when… the time when HKO issued the official… official Typhoon Signal 8. And the red line here, you can see this refers to how many stations are actually above the 63 kilometer threshold. And once there are more than 4,

Simon Wang: Four of the stations reaches the threshold.

Simon Wang: And… so here's the difference between us and HKO. We actually, don't detect guts. So you can see here, here, and, like, there are some periods that actually 4 of… 4 out of 8, the weather stations detect T8.

Simon Wang: PA wins strength, but because it's only, like, Gust, See?

Simon Wang: up and down. So we actually don't categorize this as T8. But the algorithm… the algorithm we are still, is… we are still trying to improve it further, so the result may vary at the… at the end.

Simon Wang: And we also built a…

Simon Wang: dashboard to display the eight reference weather stations. You guys can see mean wind speed and the P90 wind speed, max wind speed, and max gust.

Simon Wang: And here are some… Typhoon that we analyzed.

Simon Wang: PS, this may not be fully correct, because the algorithm is still developing, but you guys can take it as a reference. So, in later stage, we will show the official signal A duration, and how long… how much time does our algorithm detect it actually should be a TA signal.

Simon Wang: And how much in advance HKO issued their typhoon signal, and how much coverage, like, how much…

Simon Wang: I'm… the typhoon is really above T8.

Simon Wang: Compare, like, our… I wasn't detected and compared to the actual TA signal.

Simon Wang: And if it is seen on NA or 0% coverage, which means our algorithm thinks this typhoon should not be a T8 at all.

Simon Wang: And here has 3 more… How soon we analyzed, and…

Simon Wang: So here's our key findings. In our study of six typhoons, only Thailand fully meets the official signal number 8 standard. For the other typhoons, the signal was sometimes issued too early, or when the wind speed or the coverage area did not fully match the rules.

Simon Wang: And this shows that the HKSO's decision did not always match the real-time wind data.

Simon Wang: it also shows how hard it is to balance the uncertainty in focus with public safety. On top of that, it points out the need of, of the clear information, because people still do not understand how or why this signal,

Simon Wang: Decisions are made.

Simon Wang: And, when signal number 8 is issued, school closed, public transport stops, and many business shut down, it has a big advance on economy and daily life. That's why each decision is issued, signal number 8 is to carefully balance public safety and economy impacts.

Simon Wang: The HKO should make sure any warming is necessary and well explained. This way, safety is protected without causing unnecessary disturbion.

Simon Wang: And here's the recommendation. The HKO should make its decision-making process more open and clear. It means that explaining exactly how the signal number 8 is decided

Simon Wang: and use both real-time wind data and forecast model together. Ideally, the warning should come about 3-4 hours before strong wind arrives, so people have time to get home safely and find a shelter. Sometimes, fewer than 4 monitoring stations reach the signal number 8 wind standard, but

Simon Wang: The HQO should still issue the signal for safety reasons.

Simon Wang: For example, maybe the wind are strong near the coast.

Simon Wang: or the sea level is rising. In this case, they should clearly explain why the decision is made.

Simon Wang: And besides sharing more information, the government should let the public and experts join the policy discussion. It should always have a clear system of

Simon Wang: accountability and respond quickly to the public questions. Finally, a better feedback system is needed to handle the concerts and make the whole decision process more open and transparent.

Simon Wang: Hopefully, we will have the insights and the next steps.

Simon Wang: For the key preliminary insights, firstly, Insights 1 real-time wind data exposed major gaps of 6 recent signal age cases, only Typhoon…

Simon Wang: Planning in 2023 matched the official wind speed criteria with just 30.9% station coverage. Firefight others, or 0% acryl detect support. This warning rely entirely on 4K SAS.

Simon Wang: not observing winds. Second, insights to the decision process led transparency. There are no public law for the host or cancellation.

Simon Wang: times. Every 2024 to 2025 signal was labeled a foreign cost driven, with no verifiable data drew. The public defers to know why a citywide shutdown is struggled.

Simon Wang: So, to the Insights 3, effortless demand refined protocols, signal duration ranged from 670 to 1,000 active…

Simon Wang: 100 minutes. Yeah, it's most…

Simon Wang: Show the minimal alignment with real-time wind data. This pattern strongly suggests over-influence reporting life and the economy unnecessarily. Finally, insights for recent trends scream urgency. The 2024-2025 spike in early. Unsupported warning is not sustainable. We cannot keep

Simon Wang: Parent growth in media policy review is essential.

Simon Wang: So, for the research contribution, our innovative data-driven methodology integrated real-time wind data into policy analysis by breaching methodology and public

Simon Wang: governance. We fill a critical research gap with critical evidence-based recommendations that enhance transparency, accountability, and accuracy.

Simon Wang: Finally, they planned activity, the next steps are already in motion. Third… the first one is long…

Simon Wang: Longitudinal node analysis. Financing our full report with visual and refined recommendation. Second, process optimization. Processing improved decision-making framework.

Simon Wang: Third, policy development. Attaching evidence-based protocols. Finally, action. We were emailing the report to the Panel on Environmental Adference and prefacing for the tabling at the LECO meeting.

Simon Wang: Eastern our presentation, thank you.

Simon Wang: Thank you.

Simon Wang: Well, it seems that the conclusion or the finding of your team is quite,

Simon Wang: surprising, right? And also remarkable, in the sense that… can you go back to the graph that you're showing?

Simon Wang: The number of… I… I think there's one…

Simon Wang: There should be one child talking… yeah, right, right here. Okay, so this is… which…

Simon Wang: Which, time form are we talking about here? 100%.

Simon Wang: This is Ragasa. Ragasa. Which is, okay, so the most recent one, right? Yeah.

Simon Wang: Because I'm thinking…

Simon Wang: we need data, or we need presentation of not just this one, but… how many… how many typhoons did you analyze? Six. Okay, so is there one chart we can see all of them?

Simon Wang: We have him get that, but we can edit in the future.

Simon Wang: I think there are two issues here. Number one is about timing.

Simon Wang: Right? So, so… Our hypothesis is that the observatory has sometimes issued a number 8 signal too early.

Simon Wang: Right? So that's one issue. And number two is whether the signal number 8 is warranted at all.

Simon Wang: Which is a different, a separate issue. It's a related but separate issue.

Simon Wang: So are you saying that, sometimes they are not warranted at all, according to the data? Yeah. Okay.

Simon Wang: That, that's a very,

Simon Wang: significant claim, you know? Whenever you make this kind of claim, especially when the claim is significant, then you have

Simon Wang: you need extraordinary data. So basically, extraordinary claims require extraordinary data or evidence.

Simon Wang: So I would suggest you to also look at some other data, such as the number of fallen trees.

Simon Wang: Cases, the number of injuries, and we probably need to compare, different typhoons.

Simon Wang: If you find that some typhoons,

Simon Wang: not, like, number 8 are not warranted at all. Then you should… you should compare data, such as fallen trees or injuries, across different, typhoon cases.

Simon Wang: But again, I think the finding and the whole case is very significant. You know, we're going to write a full report to the lawmaker, and also we're going to write to the observatory, and we're going to give them a warning, you know, next time when they're used to

Simon Wang: signal number 8, they better take into consideration our results and findings, and they have to fully justify any decision they make on this, alright? So, yeah, so I do believe there's a lot of potential.

Simon Wang: But given the importance of this issue, I would hope that you can validate all the data that you have used to reach your conclusion, because it would be really embarrassing if later on we find that some of the data you use is not correct, or any analysis you have done is incorrect.

Simon Wang: So, we probably need someone to double-check, you know, some consultant to review everything you've done before we send a report to the Legislative Council, because as I said, I think the finding here is very significant. It can potentially influence

Simon Wang: the next time, how, observer issue signals.

Simon Wang: it's going to influence everybody in Hong Kong, right?

Simon Wang: Telly, you have any questions or comments?

Simon Wang: Have you… did you write to the observatory? What question did you ask, and what the responses are?

Simon Wang: Well, if you did not include that in your slides, maybe you want to add that to your slides. And also, I saw that you set up a website, right? Of course, you can show the QR code, but then you also probably want to include the link.

Simon Wang: To… and plus, I think you are using an IP address.

Simon Wang: But, you know, we can map the domain very easily, right? I have domain and everything. So, yeah, maybe we should set it up.

Simon Wang: It's still underdeveloped, and there are some… Okay, yeah.

Simon Wang: That's okay, yeah, yeah, but I mean, we should present things more. See, the thing is, it's all about storytelling, right? So you have to tell the story in a way that layperson can get the idea very quickly.

Simon Wang: Sorry.

Simon Wang: about the government inquiries, I will ask why Xeno 8 was hoisted in advance on 23 September, when Typhoon Walgaza was influencing Hong Kong.

Simon Wang: Instead of midnight.

Simon Wang: So… You can find the response in Google Documents, which has typed in… our project in Susan.

Simon Wang: Thank you.
