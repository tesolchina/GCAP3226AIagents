Simon Wang: Both Hikaru.

Simon Wang: Maybe you're ready.

Simon Wang: Okay, we are grouped sex.

Simon Wang: In this presentation, we'll introduce our research on optimizing Hong Kong bus stop network using ST Martin Road and Johnson Road as a case study, highlighting the context and objective.

Simon Wang: Starting with the research content and background, Hong Kong, a densely populated urban hub, grapposed with major transportation challenges, tall buildings, high population density, and heavy traffic create a complex bus stop network.

Simon Wang: Well, this support connectivity?

Simon Wang: It leads to over-cloud stop, redundant setup, and congestion, which is wasting resource and reducing efficiency. For example, some stops are less than 100 meters apart with nearly identical bus work.

Simon Wang: Which causing delay. Thus, optimization is neat.

Simon Wang: However, a critical gap exists in transport department decision making for bus stop placement and merging. Transport department relies on periodic assessment rather than the continuous data integration.

Simon Wang: and standards-led systematization, transparency, and data input from APIs. This results in inflexible placement in evolving urban dynamics. Therefore, adding real-time data in decision-making is also needed.

Simon Wang: The primary objective of our research is to recommend optimization between S.T. Martin Road and Johnson Road Station. We will analyze bus movement patterns during peak.

Simon Wang: our sphere real-time APIs data and use simulation model to recommend optimization and placement principle, like merging merge or not, and how to merge bridge transportation department gaps at these two stations to enhance efficiency.

Simon Wang: And the second objective includes… Evaluating the transfer department current decision-making process for placement and consolidation.

Simon Wang: And compare it with… our findings.

Simon Wang: to propose improved configuration that address existing gap. We aim to establish systematic placement principle for the transport department and bus company that can be applied to other sites for improvement. Elevating delays are problematic

Simon Wang: Location, reducing cost, and enhancing passenger satisfaction.

Simon Wang: Next, we are going to talk about methodology and data collection. For data collection, we… we pre…

Simon Wang: We rely on real-time API datas provided by the government open data platform. We develop Python scripted screen potential by stop.

Simon Wang: Using this platform, targeting less than 100 meters apart than I expected.

Simon Wang: exhibit congestion issue. This leads us to select ST Multimal and transmode as our case study. We also use Python to extract real-time data, including waiting times in peak or long period. Let us identify whether congestion exists.

Simon Wang: Additionally, we formally write to Transport Department requesting details on their thinking status to understand and evaluating Transport Department current decision-making for bus stop.

Simon Wang: placement is aimed to uncover gaps in their processes and gather sufficient data for subsequent simulation. For testing optimization strategy, we integrated the collected data into the simulation model and

Simon Wang: Using Python to simulate scenarios like stop merge, assessing impacts on travel time and efficiency.

Simon Wang: However, we face several challenges on data collection. Online real-time data is often neg…

Simon Wang: Granular details such as accurate passengers flows or precise rail time at stops, making it hard to ensure rather longer travel time due to congestions or other factors, like traffic signal.

Simon Wang: More of a transparency issue.

Simon Wang: Blake the process. First off, Company 9 can be insisted Bus as publicly authorized entities, refuse to disclose decision-making status.

Simon Wang: I think… confidentiality. Confidentiality.

Simon Wang: Humphrey.

Simon Wang: Confidentiality. Even the transport department requires formal correspondence for information, which was often fake and limited.

Simon Wang: hindering public access. This opacity makes it…

Simon Wang: difficult for us and ordinary citizen to fully understand government perspective, complicating the formulation of compliance and optimal strategy. To meet the case, we adopt some estimated values to handle missing data in order to complete our simulation calculation.

Simon Wang: Thank you. So now I'll go… I'm moving on to talk about the current process of our simulation that we are going to run.

Simon Wang: So, first of all, we collect data to analyze the current situation of that the bus… the two bus stop is too close to each other, so we collect the real… real-time ETA snap check,

Simon Wang: Observating, like, the peak hour and the off-peak hour for 1 hour or two hours, and converting that ETA snapshot into CVS files for analysis to help us write files and feed it to AI to analyze it and customize the situation for us.

Simon Wang: So, here is some key metrics we compute using the ETH API,

Simon Wang: We come… we computing… we computed that, some of the wait time, the pre-merge ETA counts, but also, we…

Simon Wang: come to some situation about having some new ETA. There is also some difficulty we face. And we're also trimping the top 1% of extreme weight to better represent the typical conditions, so here is some of the

Simon Wang: Graph that shows the data we collect.

Simon Wang: And I think here it is some data that we need to point out. First of all is the wait time distribution. So, we convert the data into a… into a graph, and it obviously showed that it is right-skewed, so…

Simon Wang: It indicating that It is an episode of conjection and vehicle bunching or delay reporting by the API.

Simon Wang: So, it is for the current scenario that the tool bus stop is very close to each other, and the situation is…

Simon Wang: Like this. And also, the mean wait time. So for the mean wait time is, in a bus stop. When we…

Simon Wang: how long we will have to wait for a bus at a bus stop. So, we have a blue line, indicating the first bus stop, and yellow line indicating the second bus stop. And we can obviously find that the wait time for the second bus stop is obviously higher, which is indicating that the

Simon Wang: That is a conj… that is an obvious conjunction in the first station, leading the result of the mean wait time increase in the second station. So based on all these analysis, we can find… we can easily find that the current situation is

Simon Wang: The vehicles is having a lot of conjunction, and it is not… not… Very efficient at all.

Simon Wang: So, moving on to the simulation we are aiming to do in this project, So, about the simulation.

Simon Wang: Because of the current situation, we are planning to run a simulation based on the ETA CSV data we collect, so we need to run a simulation… we want to run a simulation about a pre-merge

Simon Wang: post-merge 1 and 2. The first one is half-half split, so half of the… half… half of the bus row split.

Simon Wang: the bus rows split into two, and half of them go to one station, and the other half go to the other station. And for the second situation, we want to merge the two bus… merge two bus stops into one.

Simon Wang: So that…

Simon Wang: it'll be more efficient. But for sim… and for simulation, because the limited data we are currently having, and we haven't yet the reply from government.

Simon Wang: from government, we have some assumptions be made, and here is some of the assumption, and I think,

Simon Wang: One point, I… I think it is important to point out the base deal time. I think it is the mo… it is the most important for… about… in… from all this. So, it is…

Simon Wang: This formula is…

Simon Wang: Indicating that, for example, if we have 10 passengers, and we have a fixed… fixed sporting time.

Simon Wang: For example, like, 10 seconds, and when we had 10 passengers.

Simon Wang: And two, sorry, 2 seconds of boarding time. So when we have 10 passengers, we'll use the formula to find out, like, for example, if 10 passengers, how much time will they take?

Simon Wang: And it is 30 seconds, for example, for 10.

Simon Wang: And here is the simulation.

Simon Wang: Binding of these… of the simulation. So, here is,

Simon Wang: Table that show all the results.

Simon Wang: And summarizing this, we can obviously see that it is a decrease in the average wait time for… after we simulate the

Simon Wang: simulate a tool merging sim… the situation. For both case… both cases, we can see the average wait time has decreased significantly. And also, the number of boarding passengers increased, which means that more passengers can, go on to this… go, take the bus.

Simon Wang: Even though that is, very, very little increase in due time.

Simon Wang: But I think the pros of the merging is still bigger than the cons.

Simon Wang: But here, of course, it will be some disadvantage, for example, the remaining queue up here in the post-construction scenario that fuel passenger failed to get on the bus.

Simon Wang: As shown.

Simon Wang: So here is some of the results and summaries that we find, and we think that after… no matter both situations, after the merge is better than the pre-merge situation.

Simon Wang: So here are some insights from, from our project.

Simon Wang: And the key insights emerged regarding inefficiency at ST Martin Road and Chongsan Road.

Simon Wang: Merging the bus stops can effectively improve service efficiency, reducing redundant stops and traffic congestions. From the simulation, it indicates peak hours delays could drop by 15% to 20%, because it may reduce the bus bunching, decrease the dwell time at stops, and improve road congestion problem.

Simon Wang: But, however, as mentioned in the data collection challenges.

Simon Wang: Online real-time data fails to provide complete information. This results in simulations that may not be fully accurate.

Simon Wang: And moreover, if proceeding with implementation.

Simon Wang: Numerous factors must be considered. While merging might shorten bus congestion times, it could extend passengers' walk

Simon Wang: Can distance to the stop, which leads to the elderly, disabled, or those with heavy luggage, who have to walk further to reach up a stop.

Simon Wang: And it will let some residents lost of a closer stop, which they feel will… they have lost a direct benefit. And for… also, it will cause potential for crowding, because… and there will more people in the bus stops to…

Simon Wang: And line up, and so it will lead to… it's difficult to walk for the road.

Simon Wang: And additionally, the cost effectiveness also should be considered.

Simon Wang: We're not sure if that the effective of merging is worth the cost you paid. For example, the cost of merging, changing mobile apps, and the inconvenience and cons to the citizens, and so on. These are the costs, so we need to consider whether it is fulfilled the cost effectiveness.

Simon Wang: And first, we hope that

Simon Wang: The government can increase data transparency, and our case study aims to establish a systematic decision-making framework for,

Simon Wang: transport department, integrating real-time API data for optimization. We hope that the transport department can leverage more real-time data to refine this framework, ensuring evidence-based, proactive strategies.

Simon Wang: And let's talk about the next steps.

Simon Wang: And we plan to improve our Python code for data collection, enhancing scripts to more clearly highlight bus congestions. Also, following the Transport Department's reply, we will run more detailed simulations, incorporating additional factors such as passenger flows, environmental variables, and cost-benefits analyzed to boost accuracy.

Simon Wang: And also try to use the regression model by using different variables to create an equation to have a more accuracy data to compare the average waiting time this…

Simon Wang: is… Totally improved to, consider whether we merge the bus stop.

Simon Wang: It's the end of our presentation. Thank you.

Simon Wang: Okay, thank you for presentation. Do you mind going back to the beginning? The wait time?

Simon Wang: Hot.

Simon Wang: So, is the waiting time… Obtained from the API?

Simon Wang: Waiting time of passengers, or the waiting time of buses.

Simon Wang: You mean this one? Yeah. Yeah, it's, we get the data from API, so it's waiting time for the buses.

Simon Wang: So in, for example, in one station, how much it will… for the passenger to wait for the bus to come?

Simon Wang: I feel like, when they snap the ETA, for example, they… they snap the picture… snap the data for 30 seconds for one time, and then for, like, for example, at that moment, how long it will… the waiting time will be for the bus. I think it is the data.

Simon Wang: Hmm.

Simon Wang: I still… I'm still confused. So when you mentioned about waiting time for the buses, I would suppose there are only two

Simon Wang: berths to… for the bus to get into the station, and if… at this time there is a third bus come in, then the third bus has to wait until the two buses waiting at the berth to leave, so that they can get into the bus stop.

Simon Wang: I would suppose that the time that the third bus, when the third bus arrives at that stop.

Simon Wang: until the time it goes into the birth. That time, I will

Simon Wang: I will name it as the waiting time for the third bus.

Simon Wang: So I'm not sure whether the, what this waiting time refers to. Could you…

Simon Wang: Do you mind re-repeat, repeat the definitions?

Simon Wang: Shouldn't.

Simon Wang: And so this waiting time is from the snapshot.

Simon Wang: So, for example, in every moment, how long would the wait time for the bus at one station? That will be the estimated arrival time of the next bus. That's what ETA represents, right? Estimated arrival time.

Simon Wang: Yeah. Then that will be…

Simon Wang: like, say, at this moment, I would expect a bus will arrive in 10 minutes, so that will be the…

Simon Wang: The waiting time here?

Simon Wang: Yeah, the waiting's up.

Simon Wang: So, so we use these, like.

Simon Wang: So this is the time that…

Simon Wang: the mean wait time for, every road of the bus, like, for example, how long will it wait to go to the station? And for the blue line is the first station, and yellow line is the second station. So we use this, use this, like, this…

Simon Wang: This method to find that

Simon Wang: how… how is the conjunction for the first station? That bus have to wait in the first station and then go to the second bus? So, the difference between these two lines will be the…

Simon Wang: Like, with the conjunction time.

Simon Wang: But the bus can drive from one station to the other. How do you know whether it's waiting or it's driving?

Simon Wang: You too.

Simon Wang: So… Because 2ID and then… maybe I get the ETA of the tool ID.

Simon Wang: the time difference

Simon Wang: includes two parts. The first part is the driving time between the two stations. They are still, like, 52 meters away, so it still takes some time to drive from station one to station two. And the second part of this… this time difference is the waiting time. Maybe it's the waiting time.

Simon Wang: I think, we have to be more precise when we start looking at the data, because,

Simon Wang: As Taylor mentioned, we need to consider

Simon Wang: The estimated arrival time of different buses.

Simon Wang: on a given time. We have to compare their ETA.

Simon Wang: And if we find that several buses arrive approximately at the same time, that's when queuing would happen.

Simon Wang: You see what I mean? Because… because the whole… the key, concern of the whole situation or the problem is that we have limited number of births

Simon Wang: Of the bus stop that can only accommodate 2 buses at a time.

Simon Wang: So if… if at any given time only two buses arrive, we're okay.

Simon Wang: Right? But whenever there's more than two buses that arrive at approximately the same time, like, within 2 minutes.

Simon Wang: then that's… When the problem arises.

Simon Wang: So, we need to analyze the data by taking into account not just one bus route, two bus routes, but all the bus routes that arrive at that period of time.

Simon Wang: And also look at their ETA for 2 bus stops.

Simon Wang: And this… this can be a little bit complicated, you see what I mean?

Simon Wang: We have to feed all the data to AI, and hopefully AI will write a Python

Simon Wang: Program to help us to identify the instances where more than two buses are arriving at approximately the same time, therefore overwhelmed the bus stop.

Simon Wang: And, cause the queuing and the delay.

Simon Wang: And that's the kind of problem we have to fix.

Simon Wang: So, so I think any simulation that, you're going to do… in fact, for the current reality, the merge situation, it's not really simulation, it's more about visualization.

Simon Wang: Right? So you have to visualize what happened.

Simon Wang: And, I would say you want to go back to AI, go back to the data, and try to visualize exactly what happened, exactly when there will be more than two buses trying to

Simon Wang: You know, stop, trying to take the passengers.

Simon Wang: So that's the first part, and then you can use the similar setup

Simon Wang: To simulate what would happen if we have a merge of the bus stops.

Simon Wang: And ideally, you want to show the visualization results and the simulation results on the same chart.

Simon Wang: So that the audience will see immediately how, what kind of difference will be made.

Simon Wang: By merging the two bus stops. You see what I mean? So I think you probably already got all the data you need.

Simon Wang: Of course, you have to double-check, but what you need to do more is to basically visualize

Simon Wang: the… the reality, you know? As I mentioned, you have to be very precise to know exactly what happened.

Simon Wang: you might want to actually do a field trip, I don't know whether you have time.

Simon Wang: Because when you are on that site, you will see exactly what happened. You know, there are two buses boarding passengers, the third, even the fourth buses are waiting.

Simon Wang: Okay? And that's the… that's the kind of scenario we want to avoid.

Simon Wang: We want to prevent, because we have two bus stops.

Simon Wang: Right? We have more resources available. As long as we coordinate, we can use the resources better to achieve better outcome. You see what I mean? So I hope you can remember that's the bottom line. That's our motivation.

Simon Wang: And our job is to tell the transport department that you can do a better job without adding more resources, you see what I mean? We can always improve the situation by adding more resources.

Simon Wang: But the challenge is to be able to improve the situation without adding more resources, you see what I mean? And I hope we can propose a solution to achieve that.

Simon Wang: Yeah, I totally understand, but there is still difficulties there about collecting these data. So, it is actually from the data that we still collect a lot of bus

Simon Wang: like, the bus as the ETA time report as new, so we can get all the bus… bus data of it, and it is one of the difficulties that we are facing.

Simon Wang: Can you tell me?

Simon Wang: Lake is an email approach, Google Data, data.gov.h, digital policy office.

Simon Wang: There you go.

Simon Wang: morning peak hour.

Simon Wang: Thank you.

Simon Wang: Okay, thank you.

Simon Wang: Yeah, yeah, okay, so… I voted against you.

Simon Wang: I'll go.

Simon Wang: Yes.
