Simon Wang: So I'm like, oh, so enjoy console, haven't seen it.

Simon Wang: Our topic is municipal solid waste charging scheme. Just let me briefly give the introduction.

Simon Wang: The implementation of a municipal solid waste charging scheme represents a pivotal shift in environmental policy, aiming to reduce the landfill burden by attracting a direct cause of waste disposal. Most critically, it's forcing

Simon Wang: food waste recycling habits. However, this transition is facing a lot of significant challenges, such as public complaints and development of

Simon Wang: development of accessible infrastructure. In this project, we are going to find out and understand about the public food waste recycling habits and challenges based on collecting public opinions, including result methodological insights and suggestions.

Simon Wang: And this is our research questions. How does the implementation of municipal solder waste charging scheme influence the public's food waste recycling behavior, and what are the key determined

Simon Wang: of its success or failure. It includes public perception, practical challenges, barriers, and policy designs. These factors all influence citizens' willingness and to reduce and recycle food waste in various ways.

Simon Wang: After collecting data, we… we reached the following data.

Simon Wang: We analyze the difficulty of storage waste charting scheme and the direction of EFT policy for data and decision-making process. We collect primary data through questionnaire and collect secondary data through…

Simon Wang: Medical sources. Oh, the toy medical code.

Simon Wang: We create a questionnaire to understand people recycling happen. We collect 103 responses online, focusing on food, waste, recycled behavior, difficult, and their feel on the waste charting scheme. Here is the questionnaire, QR code, and the question example.

Simon Wang: We conduct this survey to understand citizen food waste recycling situation, what motivates people to recycling, what, Espresso Fi…

Simon Wang: Where we prevent action. How ready our community for the wage charting scheme? Also, how demographic as

Simon Wang: housing and income effort.

Simon Wang: Recycle happen. This helps us create target evatic policy requirementation.

Simon Wang: We also use secondary data for two…

Simon Wang: main resources. On property, we have resources, ETP…

Simon Wang: EPD, any report and government document to understand government policy and statistics.

Simon Wang: From academic literature, we research.

Simon Wang: international case study and behavior to study from…

Simon Wang: global experience. This helps us to make better decisions regarding food waste recycling.

Simon Wang: We directly contacted…

Simon Wang: to the government to request for two types of information. First, data transmission, including two CO24 recycling details and how they measure

Simon Wang: Participation rate. Second, Policy information about food waste.

Simon Wang: Reset the program residing rate and their key preform ones indicated.

Simon Wang: The government who… Provide us defiable data. Will you receive the key certification?

Simon Wang: sewing the…

Simon Wang: food waste recycling go over 3 years, and recycled bin number and the usage frequency. They also confirmed the policy effectiveness starting resettlementation, and stole the commitment to expand the

Simon Wang: Let's move on to the next part.

Simon Wang: Okay, now let's turn this data into the actionable insights for the foodway recycling, and what they mean for

Simon Wang: assessing the waste charging's effectiveness and using the three key visualization. The first one.

Simon Wang: As the key barriers to the fruit waste recycling discharge highlighting.

Simon Wang: The additive recyclers top challenges, and you can see in the graph is the poor management and the lack of the incentive is

Simon Wang: are the most significant, and the key takeaway is the, people are not, unwilling to recycle, but they are, they are already, participating, but the…

Simon Wang: Operational gaps, like the inconsistent, collections break the full engagement, and since the food waste recycling is,

Simon Wang: Critical to the waste charging success, and there are the fixed… the policy needs, and…

Simon Wang: The next is the demographics difference in the food waste recyclings, and on the left is the,

Simon Wang: Age, disturbing, disturbations, gaps, and you can see the

Simon Wang: blue part is the non-recycler, and the green is the recyclers. And the non-recyclers are the over, represented in the young groups, but the young people, we mined the largest

Simon Wang: Or participate groups, so they are our…

Simon Wang: Outreach, focus, via the…

Simon Wang: social media, on the right is the household, income charts. The long recycler has a significantly lower income range. That's the… than the, recycler, and the…

Simon Wang: Lower income householder, are less likely to recycle, meaning, waste charging, could this pool, potions.

Simon Wang: They, impass them and be less innovative,

Simon Wang: The final link is the RO seeker for our, logist…

Simon Wang: regressions model, and this chart shows how well we can predict food waste, recycling behavior using the

Simon Wang: check barriers and, demographics, with an AUC score of 0.

Simon Wang: 691, and our models all performed the random guessings and proving the filters, like, management gaps and their income drives recycling, and

Simon Wang: There's not just, measurements, and it shows the career partners and helps improve recycling.

Simon Wang: Effort, and make, waste charging more cents.

Simon Wang: Besides, we would also like to find out which factor affects Hong Kong residents' food waste recycling habit. In the case, we will set the response variable into a binary indicator of whether the resident has a recycling habit. Besides, the expandary variable will be

Simon Wang: how, like, the challenge that they might face when resigning for ways, that

Simon Wang: And preceded government facilities, and also the awareness of where food waste comes from. And lastly, the different demographic.

Simon Wang: So, one KB detector that we experienced

Simon Wang: the data that… which capture whether people feel government recycling facilities are sufficient. And on the right, you can see the comparison when respondents say facilities are surfaced, and about 73% report a recycling habit. When they say facilities are not

Simon Wang: So, for instance, only about… 15%, 13% rebuilt, recycling hobbit. There are 16%

Simon Wang: Point difference in relative terms. People who receive facilities and services are roughly 5.6 times less likely to recycle.

Simon Wang: So…

Simon Wang: The result is the perceived sufficient of government recycling facilities strongly and significantly associated with having a recycling habit, so it is important to improving perceived equity, visibility and confidence in

Simon Wang: Of government facility is likely to have a large impact on recycling habit.

Simon Wang: So, we also look at the region effect using wherever… where the citizens live.

Simon Wang: We found that living on Hong Kong Island shows a sizable positive effect on recycling, with boundary line and statistic significance, and columns…

Simon Wang: precedented effect is… Positive, but not certain in this sample.

Simon Wang: And surf water variable points in the expect positive directions, for example, reporting… reported varies and housing characteristics, but they are not statistically significant here.

Simon Wang: So, two reasons likely explain this. First, the sample is relatively small, which reduced power. Second, and multi-continenter T, data overlapping in what they capture, can make…

Simon Wang: Can mask individual significance.

Simon Wang: Okay, now let's look at the limitations of our study. First, our sample size was relatively small, with only 103 respondents. This means our result may not fully represent the Hong Kong… the entire Hong Kong population, and the result is…

Simon Wang: Statistical power and general ability of our regression model will be limited.

Simon Wang: Second, there would be a sampling bias in our survey work conducted online, some groups such as the elderly individual.

Simon Wang: who are less Asian online may have been excluded, and leading majority of our respondents were the young. Lastly, this uneven regional representation. Nearly 2 of 103 respondents come from the Kowloon and Newton, while only a small percentage come from Hong Kong Island.

Simon Wang: This imbalance may influence the overall funding and will affect the result result.

Simon Wang: Based on our…

Simon Wang: Based on our findings, we developed several key recommendations. Our survey showed that many respondents lacked motivation and incentive to recycling. The majority in…

Simon Wang: indicate that financial subsidy officer will be the most effective motivator for the government research focus on expanding and improving recycling infrastructure.

Simon Wang: This is including providing food waste, separate container in more areas to make participation easier, the more important.

Simon Wang: Recommendation is to establish more food waste recycling forward program, for example, our miniature inn plan could encourage consistent participation. In addition, the government could offer financial incentives, such as a discount on utility bill or test…

Simon Wang: benefit to encourage action recycling, and giveaway program offering eco-friendly products like the reusable bag or water bottle at reward.

Simon Wang: So, to conclude our briefing, our research into the public food waste recycling habits with five central, powerful insights, while economic incentives are catalysts. They are insufficient on their own for a successful waste charging scheme. And our data showing that the public's willingnesses to recycling food waste hangs

Simon Wang: Less on the fear of a change.

Simon Wang: And more, and the… persistent of conventional confine…

Simon Wang: convenient and reliable recycling system. This is further supported by the key barriers identified by active recyclers themselves. They face challenges not primarily with course.

Simon Wang: but with a lack of popularity, insufficient infrastructure, and practical inconvenience. So, the gamma graphic also pay

Simon Wang: play a role.

Simon Wang: Our findings suggest that younger adults and those in certain regions, like Hong Kong Island, are more active recyclists. However, these trends also highlight a potential gap in outreach and accessibility for other demographic groups. So, therefore, our recommendations are twofold.

Simon Wang: First, for the government.

Simon Wang: The probability must be a massive explanation and optimization, the recycling infrastructure. It means more smoke bins, better location, and reliable service. Alongside this, we proposed integrated rewards program that combines financial incentives, like

Simon Wang: builds this account with strong educational message. This addressed the lack of motivation our respondents cite. While

Simon Wang: Building long-term habits. So, this is the end of our presentation. Thank you.

Simon Wang: Alright?

Simon Wang: Thank you, thank you for your presentation.

Simon Wang: Could you go to, the slides on research question?

Simon Wang: So, the way you phrase this research question.

Simon Wang: Seems to, assume that the solid waste charging scheme will be in place.

Simon Wang: Right? It says, how does the implementation of a municipal solid waste charging scheme influence the public's food waste recycling behaviors, and what are the key determinants of its success or failure?

Simon Wang: But we all know that the Hong Kong government has already shelved

Simon Wang: The plan to introduce this solid waste charging scheme.

Simon Wang: So I think that's actually a key issue here. So, in other words, when you talk about… when we talk about this solid waste charging scheme, this is basically a hypothetical scheme, not a real scheme that will be, implemented in the foreseeable future.

Simon Wang: My suggestion would be you need to be clear about that, because you don't want to mislead the audience, right? And, we're not going to see a charging scheme.

Simon Wang: in the coming, I don't know, at least 2 or 3 years. We don't know how the government plans to do this later, but at least it won't happen for the next couple of years. So, somehow you have to revise the research question to reflect this important fact.

Simon Wang: And then, okay, so is that something maybe you want to consider and we can address? The second question, comments from me is that at the end of the day, we want to comment on the data governance of the government, right? So, how the government collects and analyze data related to this issue.

Simon Wang: So, I think you probably need to explain a little bit in terms of this area, in terms of what kind of information we gathered about data governance. In what ways should the Environmental Protection Department improve

Simon Wang: It's data governance, practices. So… so that's… that's the second, question and… and issue, yeah.

Simon Wang: Any… any response? Any quick response? Yeah.

Simon Wang: Well, you mentioned the secondary data in your presentation, right? So how… How's that.

Simon Wang: secondary data is used in your analysis. What kind of summary do they have for this secondary data?

Simon Wang: Here, basically listed the data sources and purposes, and a summary of the content.

Simon Wang: For insights from this secondary data.

Simon Wang: If no, maybe I think you could consider, including that part into the next presentation. So I suppose you… your group have read this literatures or these reports, right?

Simon Wang: So…

Simon Wang: Then give a… so my suggestion is to give a small summary of what you got from these reports, not just list the resources.

Simon Wang: Okay.

Simon Wang: And I actually have many comments regarding your visualization. I think overall, the font size is really small, it's really hard for me to read.

Simon Wang: And those bars are not yet ordered. Say, if you have a bar chart and you do not have the page number, so it's hard to… for me to… yeah, for example, this one. Maybe you could…

Simon Wang: order those spots from the longest to the shortest. So the longest spot represents the, the… the… the…

Simon Wang: the biggest barrier to the recycling. So you order it, it becomes more informative.

Simon Wang: And in your logistic regression, what are the independent variables?

Simon Wang: What are the acts?

Simon Wang: I think it's better to list them all, because I don't know what exactly variables are used.

Simon Wang: So you… I believe your why, your dependent variable, is the recycling behavior, right? So what kind of… what kind of factors

Simon Wang: will affect Y, then you regret… you regress on what variable. You need to let me know what variables you're regressing on. And when you mentioned about significance, maybe you could…

Simon Wang: also list the p-value. That is a very commonly used way to show the level of significance, right? And for the… for the AUC, for the ROC AUC, why… why it's zigzag? I rarely… rarely see those AUC like that.

Simon Wang: Is there any explanations?

Simon Wang: It usually is a smooth, or with very small rectangle zigzag, like a stepwise.

Simon Wang: Rather than this… this way.

Simon Wang: I'm not sure what… Why it is the case.

Simon Wang: Any comments?

Simon Wang: I just asked AI to help me, too. That's not a valid reason. You better understand what is… what is plotting here.

Simon Wang: It shouldn't look like this.

Simon Wang: And I remember there are 3 charging scheme-related questions, like, if the charging scheme is implemented, then, like.

Simon Wang: If, like, 50% of the net income of the scheme will be used to subsidize some… someone, how will you… how… how much will you support this scheme? Something like that. We have 3 related questions. Are those questions included in the presentation?

Simon Wang: No? So are those questions asked?

Simon Wang: I think that is, like…

Simon Wang: Assuming that this… this charging scheme will not be implemented, but we have certain, hypothes… hypothesized scenarios, like…

Simon Wang: If the…

Simon Wang: If it is implemented, then how will the income be used? Something like that. I think those questions also were to be…

Simon Wang: Included in the presentation.

Simon Wang: But overall, I think most of the most important thing is about the first research question, as Simon pointed out, because this scheme is not gonna be implemented in the short term.

Simon Wang: Yeah, the first research question needs to be, like, the wording need to be adjusted.

Simon Wang: I will, like, we need further discussion about how the results will be put in the slides.

Simon Wang: Okay, thank you.

Simon Wang: Hello, kantan yung content.

Simon Wang: significant, yeah, for lah.

Simon Wang: Then, like, at the end of the day, though, I… you know, they…

Simon Wang: at least planning, JPR, so in, like, week 13 planning, all the more stakeholder, demo, lawmaker, or the district councilor, councillor will join all the time, because already we bring a plan, we are the…

Simon Wang: supposedly, say, hopefully, they said, the, week 13 go-go presentation, who saw the, argument.

Simon Wang: say, convince the audience that something that can be done by the government, I improve the outcome. So, for the quick,

Simon Wang: comments or the question, say, over for the year.

Simon Wang: Anyone?

Simon Wang: Any, any quick comments or thoughts?

Simon Wang: Because we're supposed to have this,

Simon Wang: a Q&A session, right, so we need to have a little bit of discussion.

Simon Wang: As part of the presentation, but…

Simon Wang: There you go, same behavior Boom.

Simon Wang: So, we would like to add several points, like, the transparency after the government, dope.

Simon Wang: maybe they're… Solid waste that the… the charging… charging…

Simon Wang: charging bills, yeah, charging scheme or charging bills. After the government receives the money, they will put it into… for the public housing, or for the public area or green space in the Hong Kong, and provide it to the citizens.

Simon Wang: We'll analyze on it.

Simon Wang: I think overall, for the data analysis, you could…

Simon Wang: all in one Jupiter notebook, and share that notebook with…

Simon Wang: And I can see the opening.

Simon Wang: Okay, thank you.
