Simon Wang: email joseph at bu.mail.

Simon Wang: Okay, so we are flu shot.

Simon Wang: Okay, so this is the content page, and I will be presenting the introduction to our research, which addressed the critical public health challenge of suboptimal influenza vaccination among Hong Kong schools' children.

Simon Wang: The background of this issue is clear. Annual flu breakouts place a heavy burden on our city. Which children being key transmitter? Well, we will have safe and effective vaccines, the uptake rates in our school are unacceptably and persistently low.

Simon Wang: Current promotion strategies in school are often inconsistent and rely on conventional methods that have proven ineffective at a large scale.

Simon Wang: This creates a critical gap between public health policy and real-world outcomes.

Simon Wang: The fundamental problem we identified is not a lack of will, but a lack of intelligence.

Simon Wang: Our core barrier is the absence of some systematic data governance.

Simon Wang: Currently, valuable data exists in isolated silos in schools, clinics, and government departments, but it is not integrated or analyzed effectively.

Simon Wang: Crucially, we collect data on how many children are vaccinated, but we fail to capture why parents refuse, or which promotional status actually work.

Simon Wang: This leaves school administrators and health officials operating in the dark, unable to optimize their strategy or resources.

Simon Wang: Therefore, our research aims to solve this by creating an integrated framework. We propose to combine method…

Simon Wang: Mathematical modeling with robust data governance. This means we will first work to improve how data is collected and managed.

Simon Wang: Then, we will use this high-quality data to build predictive models

Simon Wang: These models will allow schools to simulate the potential impacts of different promotion strategies before implementing them, ensuring that limited resources are invested in the most effective intervention.

Simon Wang: The significance of this research is that it provides a practical, evidence-based toolkit to move from reactive to proactive health promotion.

Simon Wang: It will not only improve flu vaccination rates, but also create a replicable model for tackling other health issues in our educational system, ultimately leading to better health outcomes for all children in Hong Kong.

Simon Wang: Now, I will give some discussion of the mathematical model and data collection.

Simon Wang: Based on the paper.

Simon Wang: Influence Fashion Affectiveness Against the Influence Associates Hospitalization in Children in Hong Kong, published in 2010-20.

Simon Wang: They built up a model for the analysis, the data collected in the hospital, and the purpose of this model is to give a test of negative case control study using 10 years.

Simon Wang: of hospital admission data. And based on this model, we adjusted a school-based model that's applicable in school.

Simon Wang: And we have changed two variables, which is starter. We're changing the measuring variable from per week to the same school and class, and we add a new variable, because it is very important factor to affect race.

Simon Wang: if… shouldn't… Join, extracurricular activities, like sports.

Simon Wang: And I will give some data collection, and we have created a questionnaire for further data collection.

Simon Wang: And the detailed questions are in a link, and I want to highlight one specific question. It's about the e-health

Simon Wang: In recent years, Hong Kong government

Simon Wang: has promoted and implemented a eHealth application, but you can see that on…

Simon Wang: over 90% of respondents, they have heard about eHealth application, but only around 60% of the respondents, they have downloaded eHealth, which indicates that

Simon Wang: if people heard about eHealth, their willingness of download the eHealth is much more lower, and it is recommended that the Hong Kong government should

Simon Wang: increase the willingness of the public for download the eHealth

Simon Wang: For the next part, I will invite my groupmates for further discussion.

Simon Wang: Thanks for the invitation. So I want to, discuss

Simon Wang: discuss the cultural influence for our topic. So, because our goal is to explore the causality.

Simon Wang: That means, if the vaccination reduced the risk of the influenza infection. So I used the causal model. And then, first of all, I want to share a poem written by, Robert Frost.

Simon Wang: And then this is a reward, the basic fundamental problem for our causality model. Just have a look. And then this is a picture I want to share with you guys.

Simon Wang: So prob… so basically, I use the potential outcome framework.

Simon Wang: Basically, I define Y1i as, Y1i and Y0i for two potential outcomes. One is with, vaccination, then, the next one is without vaccination. So, only DI can be 1 or 0.

Simon Wang: So, so simply means, it cannot be both 1 and 0. So, basically, the difference between Y1i and Y0i can be described as individual treatment causal effect. That means, for one child.

Simon Wang: If the difference is negative, then it prevents the infection for a child.

Simon Wang: And then, we… but we want… what we want to know is not the individual, it's the average effect. That means it's for the population. So, I just, focused the… from individual effect to average effect.

Simon Wang: So, when we are talking about ATT, that… the population effect, or the cultural inference for the average effect, is

Simon Wang: an expectation of Y1i minus Y0i, given DI equals 1. That simply means the average causal effect of our

Simon Wang: The vaccination, given the children population get vaccinated, or you can say among those who actually receive it.

Simon Wang: Receive it. And then?

Simon Wang: So, here is the problem. Because we want to know The population cost of effect.

Simon Wang: the causality. So, as you can see from the picture, for any individual, we can observe only one of the two potential outcomes. We cannot observe both two outcomes. So that means for if… if DI equals to one, you cannot observe

Simon Wang: or you cannot capture Y, Yi, and Y0i. So this is the problem. So we… what we do observe is the factual outcome, but what we do not observe is the counterfactual outcome. So this is, what I want to talk about, the selection bias.

Simon Wang: So, for our cases, for our flu vaccination, what I want to say is.

Simon Wang: The unobserved counterfactual leads to the gap between what we can observe in the data we collect and the causal effect we really want to know, we're really interested in.

Simon Wang: So, what I want to say is, actually, we can observe the difference in the average house, or you can say, what you observe is the difference for

Simon Wang: for the, the causality or the cultural influence of the flu vaccination. So, what we can observe is YYI given DI equals to 1 minus Y0i given DI equals to 0. This is what you can observe.

Simon Wang: However.

Simon Wang: what I have to mention that the actual… the real causal effect, or the real causality, is not what you observe. It's EY1I given DI equals to 1 minus Y1i given DI equals to 1. So that means the first expression is what you want to know, or what you're interested in.

Simon Wang: So what do you want to… what you're interested in is not what you can observe.

Simon Wang: So, ATT, the average treatment effect on the treaty, that means the average treatment effect on the fluent vaccination for Hong Kong child, for our population. But,

Simon Wang: Then the second expression is what you cannot observe. What you cannot observe is the selection bias. So, this is very important, how you randomization for your sampling, but this is maybe a little bit difficult for this stage. So, what we… what I do is to minus

Simon Wang: Y 0i given DI equal to 1, and then plus 0I given DI equals to 1. So, keep the expression

Simon Wang: same. So that means there is a selection bias, what you cannot observe, or you want to eliminate, remove the selection bias, or this is what we want to do at next stage, or to improve our model to improve regression.

Simon Wang: So…

Simon Wang: As I said, this is what you want in the red one, but the black one below is what you cannot observe, what you cannot capture, and then this is what you can observe.

Simon Wang: So, that means selection bias, maybe, generally speaking, is very related to your randomization, or what your assignment rule. So, maybe underestimated or overestimate. However, for our case, I do think the EY0I given DI equals to Y is

Simon Wang: less than Y0i, given DI to 0, because maybe, what you select… what… for example.

Simon Wang: This Hong Kong child effect may be more health conscious. They may, their parents may count them washing hands, or wear masking, or better protection.

Simon Wang: But this is… cannot represent this all Hong Kong child. Maybe the sample or the Hong Kong child, the sampling you select is not… cannot be representative. Maybe they are more… more conscious on… on the house. So, so even though they do not

Simon Wang: So the child you select, even though they do not go to flu vaccination, they may be better. They may be… they may be… they may be, also have the lower risk to, to, to, to, to get infection for the flu, influenza. So that means the exception bias also exists.

Simon Wang: So that means…

Simon Wang: making what we can observe in the data appear more protective than the really cost-effect. So that is the guessing. And then I want to pass my time to my groupmates.

Simon Wang: Discover that if we want to analyze the… data, all that.

Simon Wang: Okay, so… Oh, okay.

Simon Wang: we found that the government did not collect any data, or they don't want to give up, so it's hard for us to analyze the data. And if we compare the model that we talked about before to analyze the

Simon Wang: Foso Rage.

Simon Wang: And, the data we can file that if the government is going to use the Yee Health app?

Simon Wang: that I think the Singapore is also a… will create a major gap, because that… It's hard to…

Simon Wang: for the… Not hurt, and the government did not standardize that.

Simon Wang: What is equal to this interval, and also the vacation type and the vacancy is also a very…

Simon Wang: will create also a major gap before it. And first, I will talk about that you will have an unstructed data problem in the eHealth. First, that we found that in the Hong Kong that many

Simon Wang: hospital, and many doctors is going to use the fee test note, rather than… and this will create a significant barrier to efficiency and timeless data extraction for public health research and research, because that in the…

Simon Wang: In this column, you can see that there is just…

Simon Wang: If they try to improve that sustainable, but…

Simon Wang: And also the travel history, and also a link.

Simon Wang: Yeah, it's what we filed, eat her more.

Simon Wang: More detailedly, and… We can… It's a file that they are missing true case.

Simon Wang: Hmm… And also, the true… missing 2K will lead that to our…

Simon Wang: Wrong controlling, and also, it will lead to a… GitHub gap?

Simon Wang: Lead to a failing in a compensation.

Simon Wang: Oh, marry you.

Simon Wang: Important data.

Simon Wang: in our… Analyze, because you can see that a high inflation rate among the children, but…

Simon Wang: It does not mean that…

Simon Wang: This, if we do not count with the dose count rate, that we can see that

Simon Wang: It is a high inflation rate among the children, but the children, some of them may get two or three more, so it's hard for us to analyze that, true.

Simon Wang: Effective rate, and also the type is also very important for that different type of the food that will have different…

Simon Wang: If it's the same?

Simon Wang: Yeah, I would pass it.

Simon Wang: So… From previous, teammates analysis, we can found that the biggest barriers To increase school children.

Simon Wang: Participation, participation rate…

Simon Wang: is the data governance. Therefore, before we get more accessible data, we wish to convey our findings to government and call for intermediate rectification in the following three critical areas.

Simon Wang: First, it's about data integrations.

Simon Wang: So, we think… We should break down the interdepartmental data silos.

Simon Wang: And… initiate a pilot data sharing program between health and education departments.

Simon Wang: Without consolidated data, all the analysis is about a castle in the air. And second is about symptoms standardization.

Simon Wang: Currently, many… Clinic… clinic record is, Clinic… clinic symptom is…

Simon Wang: Record by a doctor's free text.

Simon Wang: But the problem is a computer can… may not 100% understand what does the doctor already say, so…

Simon Wang: We should be placing the free text record by… standardized DIGIC, system.

Simon Wang: And thirdly, It's about managing data, mincing data… Completeness.

Simon Wang: If even a specific venting type and number completely… I cannot completely record it.

Simon Wang: Any assessment of NSINC become distort.

Simon Wang: And we call for mandatory improvement in recording this information, otherwise we can not, ascertain Vansing through protective capacity.

Simon Wang: And in summary, our objective is call upon the governments to take immediate action to address these critical data gaps. It is not merely about boosting venting.

Simon Wang: vaccination rates, but about establishing a truthful and reliable data foundation for our children's health.

Simon Wang: Mrs.

Simon Wang: That's confusing.

Simon Wang: Something.

Simon Wang: the math part.

Simon Wang: I think the,

Simon Wang: To be honest, I think the presentation is also fragmented. Like, I cannot see the clear link between different parts.

Simon Wang: For example, starting from the first The conditional logistic regression.

Simon Wang: Maybe, could you go back to the slides?

Simon Wang: Yeah, go to the… yes, go to this part.

Simon Wang: The purpose is not to do the study, the purpose is to quantify the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine.

Simon Wang: And…

Simon Wang: So this is the original model, and it is based on the hospital, admitted patients due to the, like, the,

Simon Wang: upper respiratory… infect… infection or something. Then what… what is about the next model?

Simon Wang: Go to the next page.

Simon Wang: Finally.

Simon Wang: We are proposing a… Like, a new model to… to be implemented in the school-based.

Simon Wang: context.

Simon Wang: So, based on your literature review, has anyone has

Simon Wang: has done this kind of school-based model before.

Simon Wang: I think if yes, if yes, maybe you could consider referring to that model. If no, what's the reason of no?

Simon Wang: I actually searched school-based model, and based on my limited searching, I do not find anyone who has done the school-based model yet, but there must be a reason.

Simon Wang: Because I use AI to adjust the model based on the previous model.

Simon Wang: Mmm…

Simon Wang: I think you'd better search the other references, so whether there's anyone who has done similar research before, and if no, there must be a reason, then you may discuss the reason with the AI, rather than just trying to copy the model.

Simon Wang: I think there are many challenges in the implementation, from the implementation perspective.

Simon Wang: It's not about whether the model will work, it's about whether the…

Simon Wang: Data collected are having good qualities, like in the hospital-based.

Simon Wang: And then goes to the, like, the causal inference, and… That's from…

Simon Wang: Yeah, here. I remember in the survey, there's more…

Simon Wang: more than these two questions, right? Yes, because I just want to highlight this question in the presentation, because the other question is just the basic question about the vaccination. And here, I just want to highlight the question about the health implementation.

Simon Wang: Yeah, so from that…

Simon Wang: effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, then jumps to the e-house, and then jumps to causal inference, right?

Simon Wang: And then jump to… where?

Simon Wang: overall, I can… it's hard for me to… to have a clear, like, storyline of the whole presentation.

Simon Wang: I think, I'm not sure how to…

Simon Wang: Reorganize the content of this presentation to make it clear.

Simon Wang: That's my suggestion.

Simon Wang: Right.

Simon Wang: Alright, thank you for the presentation. So, if you go back to… there's one slide which you actually refer to some newspaper.

Simon Wang: letter, right? So I remember there's one slide you, Refer to the data.

Simon Wang: I believe that that's probably from a letter we published earlier, right?

Simon Wang: So, I wonder if you have contacted the Department of Health

Simon Wang: For more recent data, because the data here is back in 16 to 17.

Simon Wang: Alright, so I think the Department of Health should have data for 23 to 24.

Simon Wang: Yeah.

Simon Wang: So… I guess one basic step you need to take

Simon Wang: Although it may be a bit late, but still you can do is to contact the Department of Health for more updated data.

Simon Wang: About, vaccination rates among school children, because

Simon Wang: As you can see, in recent, there's some recent news about the unfortunate death of, you know, flu patients who are schoolchildren.

Simon Wang: So this is actually a real concern for the community, right? So I suppose you want to look into the current data and see, because we don't know about the current rate. It might be higher, right? It could be higher than 18.7%.

Simon Wang: But, even it's, like, 20 or 30-something, it's still not good enough. But, I mean, that should be the starting point of any discussion, right? Because that's the data we need.

Simon Wang: And also, Talia pointed out that we need to look at the previous literature to see if there's any study that has been done on school data.

Simon Wang: If not.

Simon Wang: we want to make sure that there's no, right? If there are any, then we should reference them. If there's no, then,

Simon Wang: Well, we can't really know why, but we can try to approach

Simon Wang: Some of the researchers in this area, you know, sending them a cold email.

Simon Wang: I think there's still a chance to get a reply. You know, maybe they will ignore us, but if we raise some legitimate and interesting questions, there are a chance that they will reply.

Simon Wang: Because, these are important and interesting questions.

Simon Wang: So, again, that's another step you might want to take, which is to approach the scholars.

Simon Wang: Because every paper you can find, they have a corresponding author, and they have an email address. So that, that's, that's basically, how you want to contact them and raise some questions.

Simon Wang: But before you do that, you have to do a little bit of homework, and you have to do a preparation. So any questions that you raise would be interesting, would be relevant, would be professional, and then hopefully we will get some response.

Simon Wang: Yeah, so… I… I think we…

Simon Wang: Because I recorded the whole scripts, I mean, your presentation and our Q&A session. We're going to feed these scripts to the AI, so AI can give us a bit suggestions in terms of how to improve the organization, and how to improve the overall approach.

Simon Wang: of our study. Alright, so, again, I do believe that this is a very promising and important topic.

Simon Wang: We just need to do a bit more work, so there will be some interesting insights, that we can get from the study that can help the government to do a better job.

Simon Wang: Alright.

Simon Wang: Okay, thank you.

Simon Wang: I'll drop handbags.
