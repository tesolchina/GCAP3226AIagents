# Completed Project Roadmap

## Original Roadmap

Our main focus is to investigate the extent to which the government staff have made their decisions while being fully informed by data, or in other words, taking a data-driven approach. 
Our job is to identify a set of decisions made by the government and explore how these decisions could be made by a better data governance regime.  There are essentially two scenarios: the reality which we need to find out by approaching the government; the ideal scenario (as if we live a perfect world)- here the government's decisions are fully informed by the data and rigorous math reasoning. 

Talia and I have discussed two projects - one is about typhoon and another is about 

I think I talked about this in week 1, week 2, week 3 and week 4 lectures

# Research Project Roadmap: Assessing Data-Driven Government Decision-Making

**Project Title:** Bridging the Gap: Assessing Data Integration, Governance, and Evidence Use in Public Sector Decision-Making

**Principal Investigators:** [Your Name] and Talia [Taliaâ€™s Last Name]

**Project Duration:** 12 Months (Adaptable based on academic calendar/funding cycle)

---

## 1. Project Objectives and Research Questions

### 1.1. Core Objectives

1.  **Assess Current State:** Empirically measure the degree to which specific governmental decisions are informed by quantitative data and rigorous analytical reasoning (the "Reality Scenario").
2.  **Model Ideal State:** Develop a theoretical framework for optimal data governance and analytical rigor that would constitute fully data-driven decision-making (the "Ideal Scenario").
3.  **Identify Gaps and Barriers:** Systematically identify the organizational, technical, cultural, and policy barriers preventing the realization of the Ideal Scenario.
4.  **Develop Policy Recommendations:** Formulate evidence-based recommendations for improving data governance, infrastructure, and analytical capacity to foster more data-driven public sector outcomes.

### 1.2. Key Research Questions (RQs)

**RQ1 (Descriptive):** To what extent were official decisions in the selected case studies based on quantifiable data, predictive models, or rigorous statistical analysis, as opposed to intuition, precedent, or political considerations?

**RQ2 (Comparative):** What are the key differences in data availability, quality, accessibility, and utilization between the decision-making processes in the "Reality Scenario" and the theoretical "Ideal Scenario" for the chosen policy areas?

**RQ3 (Explanatory):** What are the primary organizational, technical, and cultural factors (e.g., data literacy, data governance structures, IT architecture) that mediate the adoption of data-driven decision-making in the public sector?

**RQ4 (Prescriptive):** What specific reforms to data governance, analytical infrastructure, and staff training are necessary to move the observed decision-making processes closer to the ideal, data-informed standard?

## 2. Methodology for Analyzing Government Decisions

This project employs a **Mixed-Methods Comparative Case Study Approach**, grounded in Public Policy Analysis and Data Governance theory.

### 2.1. Research Design: Comparative Case Study

We will select two distinct policy domains that rely heavily on forecasting, resource allocation, and rapid response, allowing for clear comparison between data-intensive and potentially politically sensitive decision points.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Unit of Analysis** | Specific, discrete policy decisions or resource allocation events within the selected case studies. |
| **Data Sources** | Official reports, internal memos, meeting minutes, interview transcripts, policy documentation, and available public datasets. |
| **Analytical Framework** | **Evidence-Informed Policy Framework:** Mapping decision inputs (data used, models applied) against decision outputs (policy choice, resource allocation). |

### 2.2. Defining "Data-Driven" (Operationalization)

We will operationalize "data-driven" using a multi-dimensional scale (e.g., a 5-point Likert scale or categorical bins) based on the presence and rigor of:

1.  **Data Availability & Quality:** Were necessary, high-quality datasets available?
2.  **Analytical Depth:** Was the data subjected to basic aggregation, advanced statistical modeling, or simulation?
3.  **Integration into Process:** Was the data analysis formally integrated into the decision gate/approval process?
4.  **Transparency & Reproducibility:** Could the analysis leading to the decision be independently audited or replicated?

### 2.3. Reality vs. Ideal Modeling

*   **Reality Scenario:** Determined through empirical data collection (interviews, document review) regarding *what actually happened*.
*   **Ideal Scenario:** Modeled by applying established best practices in data science, predictive analytics, and robust governance (e.g., GDPR principles, open data standards) to the *same policy problem*, establishing the potential ceiling for data utilization.

---

## 3. Specific Case Studies

We will analyze two distinct policy areas to ensure the findings are not sector-specific.

### Case Study 1: Typhoon/Disaster Response and Resource Allocation

*   **Focus Decision:** Allocation of emergency resources (personnel, supplies, evacuation mandates) immediately preceding and following a specific, recent major typhoon event.
*   **Data Focus:** Meteorological forecasts, historical damage assessment data, real-time sensor data (if applicable), population density maps, and logistical supply chain data.
*   **Research Goal:** To determine if resource allocation was optimized based on predicted impact zones versus being based on historical precedent or political geography.

### Case Study 2: [To be finalized, suggested areas below]

We propose selecting a decision area that involves long-term planning and budget allocation, contrasting with the rapid response of Case Study 1.

**Suggestion A: Public Health Policy (e.g., Vaccination Rollout or Chronic Disease Management)**
*   **Focus Decision:** Determining priority groups and distribution logistics for a recent public health initiative.
*   **Data Focus:** Epidemiological models, demographic data, healthcare utilization rates, and budget constraints.
*   **Research Goal:** To assess the use of predictive modeling for resource staging and the integration of disparate health data silos.

**Suggestion B: Urban Planning/Infrastructure Investment**
*   **Focus Decision:** Selection of sites for a new public transport line or major infrastructure upgrade.
*   **Data Focus:** Traffic flow data, economic impact assessments, population growth projections, environmental impact reports.
*   **Research Goal:** To evaluate the weighting given to quantitative projections versus qualitative stakeholder feedback in capital investment decisions.

## 5. Stakeholder Engagement Strategies

Effective engagement is crucial given the sensitive nature of analyzing internal government processes.

| Stakeholder Group | Interest/Role | Engagement Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Government Decision-Makers** | Provide context, validate findings, implement recommendations. | Confidential, one-on-one interviews; Offer preliminary, non-attributable feedback sessions. |
| **Government Data/IT Staff** | Provide technical insight on data availability and infrastructure. | Technical workshops; Focus on process improvement rather than blame. |
| **Policy Researchers/Academics** | Provide theoretical grounding and methodological critique. | Regular internal project meetings; Formal peer review sessions. |
| **Public/Civil Society Groups** | Represent the ultimate beneficiaries of better policy; provide external validation. | Public-facing summary presentation (post-data collection); Soliciting feedback on policy impact. |

**Ethical Consideration:** A clear agreement on anonymity and data usage prior to interviews is mandatory, especially when discussing failures or data gaps.

## 6. Data Collection and Analysis Frameworks

### 6.1. Data Collection Framework

| Data Type | Source | Collection Tool | Analysis Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Qualitative (Process)** | Interviews, Meeting Minutes | NVivo/Dedoose for coding | Identifying decision heuristics, perceived data barriers, governance structure. |
| **Quantitative (Inputs/Outputs)** | Official Statistics, Public Datasets | R/Python scripts | Descriptive statistics, time-series analysis, correlation testing. |
| **Artifactual (Governance)** | Policy documents, IT roadmaps | Document analysis matrix | Assessing formal mandates for data use, data ownership clarity. |

### 6.2. Analysis Framework

1.  **Thematic Coding (Qualitative):** Coding interview transcripts using emergent themes related to data trust, analytical capacity, and organizational culture.
2.  **Decision Mapping (Process):** Creating flowcharts for each case study decision, explicitly marking points where data was introduced, ignored, or modified.
3.  **Gap Quantification (Comparative):** Using the operationalized "data-driven" scale (Section 2.2) to assign scores to the Reality and Ideal Scenarios, calculating the quantitative difference (the governance gap).
4.  **Causal Inference (Explanatory):** Using regression analysis (if sufficient quantitative data exists across multiple instances) or structured causal process tracing (qualitative) to link specific governance variables (e.g., lack of a Chief Data Officer) to lower data utilization scores.

## 8. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk Category | Specific Risk | Probability/Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Access & Cooperation** | Government officials decline interviews or withhold sensitive documents. | Medium/High | Secure high-level institutional endorsement early; Guarantee strict anonymity; Focus on process improvements, not individual blame. |
| **Data Quality/Availability** | Data required for the "Ideal Scenario" modeling is proprietary or non-existent. | High/Medium | Focus modeling on *plausible* data requirements; Clearly document data limitations as a finding of the research itself. |
| **Scope Creep** | Case studies become too broad or involve too many sub-agencies. | Medium/Medium | Strictly adhere to the defined decision points (Section 3); Establish clear boundaries in Phase 1. |
| **Interpretation Bias** | Researchers impose their own definition of "ideal" without sufficient ground-truthing. | Medium/High | Incorporate data governance experts into the review process (Phase 4); Use triangulation across multiple data sources (interviews, documents). |
