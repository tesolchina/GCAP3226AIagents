**Specific Focus Areas:**
- Bus stop placement efficiency and optimization
- Merge candidate identification and impact assessment
- Passenger accessibility and service level maintenance
- Urban transportation efficiency improvement strategies

## Detailed Project Timeline (Weeks 5-13)

### Phase 1: Planning & Initial Data Collection (Weeks 5-7)

#### Week 5: Project Scoping & Planning (Current Week)
**Tasks:**
- Finalize research question and scope
- Assign team roles (see Section 3)
- Draft enquiry email to Transport Department under Code on Access to Information
- Begin analysis of existing bus stop optimization materials

**Government Enquiry Template:**
> **Subject:** Request for Information under the Code on Access to Information: Bus Stop Placement and Optimization Data
> 
> **To:** Access to Information Officer, Transport Department
> 
> **Dear Access to Information Officer,**
> 
> We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. As part of our final project, we are studying the decision-making processes related to bus stop placement, merging decisions, and urban transportation optimization.
> 
> Under the principles of the Code on Access to Information, we would be grateful if you could provide us with the following information:
> 
> 1. What specific quantitative data points (e.g., ridership statistics, passenger flow patterns, accessibility metrics) are used to inform bus stop placement and merging decisions?
> 2. Could you provide any public reports or policy documents that outline the standard operating procedures for bus stop optimization and accessibility maintenance?
> 3. What data-driven criteria are used to evaluate the effectiveness of bus stop placement and inform future optimization strategies?

**Deliverable:** Submit one-page project plan and draft enquiry email to supervisors for feedback.

#### Week 6: Fieldwork & Primary Data Request (No Class)
**Tasks:**
- Send approved enquiry email to Transport Department
- Begin intensive secondary data collection
- Conduct fieldwork at bus stops (with permission)
- Analyze existing bus stop optimization materials

**Actionable Instructions:**
- Search for transportation data on data.gov.hk
- Collect bus stop location and ridership data
- Review Transport Department annual reports
- Analyze existing bus stop optimization materials from course
- Create shared document to log all sources

**Deliverable:** Copy of sent email with timestamp and preliminary bibliography of at least 10 secondary sources.

#### Week 7: Data Consolidation & Model Selection
**Tasks:**
- Organize all collected secondary data
- Review any response from Transport Department
- Decide on mathematical model (Regression or Simulation)

**Model Choice Justification:**
- **Choose Regression** if focusing on predicting ridership patterns, passenger flow, or accessibility impacts based on demographic factors, location characteristics, or service levels
- **Choose Simulation** if modeling complex bus stop optimization scenarios, passenger flow patterns, or multi-objective optimization strategies

**Deliverable:** One-paragraph justification for model choice, submitted to Dr. Wu for approval.

### Phase 2: Modelling & Analysis (Weeks 8-10)

#### Weeks 8-9: Building "The Ideal" Scenario
**Tasks:**
- Develop mathematical model for optimal bus stop placement and merging
- Clean dataset and run model
- Document assumptions, variables, and methodology

**Regression Model Approach:**
- **Dependent Variable:** Ridership patterns, passenger flow, accessibility metrics
- **Independent Variables:** Demographics, location characteristics, service levels, accessibility requirements
- **Analysis:** Identify key factors affecting bus stop optimization

**Simulation Model Approach:**
- **System Definition:** Urban transportation system with bus stop network
- **Variables:** Passenger flow patterns, stop locations, accessibility requirements, service levels
- **Scenarios:** Different merging strategies, placement optimization, accessibility maintenance

**Deliverable:** Preliminary model results and draft methodology section.

#### Week 10: Synthesizing Reality & Ideal
**Tasks:**
- Compare current bus stop placement practices with model results
- Identify gaps between current approach and data-driven optimization
- Analyze potential consequences of current limitations

**Deliverable:** Bullet-point summary of comparative analysis.

### Phase 3: Reporting & Finalization (Weeks 11-13)

#### Week 11: Drafting Recommendations & Report Writing
**Tasks:**
- Formulate 3-5 concrete, evidence-based recommendations
- Each team member writes assigned section (~500 words each)
- Ensure recommendations address identified gaps

**Sample Recommendations:**
1. "Implement regression-based ridership prediction models to optimize bus stop placement and improve service efficiency"
2. "Develop simulation models for bus stop merging scenarios to identify optimal strategies while maintaining accessibility"
3. "Establish data-driven criteria for bus stop optimization and continuous improvement"

**Deliverable:** Complete first draft of entire group report.

#### Week 12: Peer Review, Editing & Consolidation
**Tasks:**
- Edit entire report for consistency, clarity, and tone
- Check grammar, citations, and formatting
- Ensure cohesive narrative flow

**Deliverable:** Near-final version of report, ready for final proofread.

#### Week 13: Final Submission
**Tasks:**
- Final proofread and submission
- Prepare presentation materials

**Deliverable:** 2,500-3,000 word group research report.
