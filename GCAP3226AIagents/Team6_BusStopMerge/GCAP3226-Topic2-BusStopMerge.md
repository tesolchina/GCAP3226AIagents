# GCAP3226 Topic 2: Bus Stop Merger Analysis

> **Course**: [[topic selection and group formation]]
> **Project Type**: Urban Transport Planning
> **Status**: Previous work available for review

## Project Overview
Analyzing whether merging two bus stops only 25 meters apart improves transport efficiency and accessibility.

## Key Information
- **Specific Case**: Two stops 25m apart (location TBD)
- **Previous Work**: Some preliminary analysis completed
- **Focus**: Efficiency vs accessibility trade-offs
- **Impact**: Could influence citywide stop planning

## Research Focus
### Primary Questions
- Optimal distance between consecutive bus stops
- Accessibility impact on different user groups
- Operational cost implications of merging
- User experience changes (elderly, disabled, families)

### Methodology
1. **Baseline**: Map locations, usage patterns, accessibility
2. **Impact Modeling**: Walking distances, cost-benefit analysis
3. **Decision Framework**: Merger criteria development
4. **Implementation**: Step-by-step process guidelines

## Key Considerations
### Benefits of Merging
- Reduced operational costs
- Improved traffic flow
- Simplified route planning

### Potential Drawbacks
- Increased walking distances
- Accessibility challenges
- Possible overcrowding

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear recommendation for specific stop merger
- Generalizable decision framework
- Accessibility impact assessment
- Stakeholder consultation integration
