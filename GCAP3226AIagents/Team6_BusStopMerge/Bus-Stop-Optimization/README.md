# Bus Stop Merger Optimization Project

## Project Overview
Advanced urban planning analysis evaluating whether merging adjacent bus stops improves public transport efficiency and accessibility.

## Case Study
St. Martin Road and Chong San Road stations (52 meters apart) used as primary analysis case.

## Research Foundation
- Master's-level research with Python-based discrete-event simulation
- Real KMB Open Data API integration
- Working Jupyter notebook with operational simulation models
- Four scenarios analyzed: Current setup, designated routes, merged superstation, single-station
