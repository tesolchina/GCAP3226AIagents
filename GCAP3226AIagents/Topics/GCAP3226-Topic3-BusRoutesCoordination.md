# GCAP3226 Topic 3: Bus Routes Coordination

> **Course**: [[topic selection and group formation]]
> **Project Type**: Inter-Operator Coordination Analysis
> **Status**: Initial analysis completed

[[GCAP3056/moodle forum post GCAP 3056 -Topic 2 Bus Stop Merger Optimization Project]] 

## Project Overview
Analyzing potential for coordinating schedules between competing bus routes (272A-KMB and 582-CityBus) sharing 8 overlapping stops.

## Key Information
- **Route 272A**: KMB operated
- **Route 582**: CityBus operated
- **Overlap**: 8 shared bus stops
- **Challenge**: Different operators, separate scheduling
- **Previous Work**: Some initial analysis available

## Research Focus
### Primary Questions
- How can competing operators coordinate for mutual benefit?
- Strategies to minimize passenger waiting times
- Operational and financial implications for both operators
- Current passenger experience with overlapping service

### Methodology
1. **Current State**: Map 8 stops, analyze timetables, identify gaps
2. **Coordination Modeling**: Optimal scheduling, passenger flow simulation
3. **Business Case**: Cost-benefit for both operators
4. **Implementation**: Practical coordination mechanisms

## Coordination Strategies
### Potential Approaches
- **Complementary Scheduling**: Alternate departures
- **Peak/Off-Peak Division**: Time-based operator responsibility
- **Stop-Specific**: Targeted high-traffic coordination

### Challenges
- Competitive dynamics between operators
- Revenue sharing considerations
- Regulatory framework limitations

## Expected Outcomes
- Quantified passenger waiting time reductions
- Viable business model for both operators
- Realistic implementation pathway
- Regulatory and policy recommendations
