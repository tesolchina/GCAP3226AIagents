# Flu Shot Project Roadmap - Team 1

## Project Focus
**Research Question:** To what extent does the Hong Kong government use data-driven approaches in flu vaccination campaign planning and resource allocation?

## Current Status: Week 8 (October 19, 2024)

## Phase 1: Data Collection & Research (Weeks 8-9) - URGENT

### Immediate Actions (Week 8 - This Week)
• **SEND government enquiry TODAY** to Department of Health under Code on Access to Information
• **Collect secondary data** from data.gov.hk, Census Department, Center for Health Protection
• **Design survey questionnaire** for field data collection (target: parents/elderly)
• **Literature review** on flu vaccination effectiveness and policy studies

### Week 9 Actions (While waiting for government response)
• **Conduct field surveys** at vaccination centers and community locations
• **Analyze available secondary data** from public sources
• **Begin mathematical model design** based on available data
• **Prepare preliminary analysis** framework

### Data Sources Priority
• Department of Health vaccination records (2022-2023, pre-COVID)
• Hospital Authority hospitalization data for flu-related cases
• School-based vaccination program effectiveness data
• Demographic and accessibility factors

## Phase 2: Mathematical Modeling (Weeks 10-11)

### Model Selection (Week 10)
• **Regression Analysis:** Predict vaccination rates based on demographics, accessibility, campaign factors
• **Simulation Model:** Test different resource allocation strategies and targeting approaches

### Key Variables
• **Dependent:** Vaccination rates, hospitalization reduction
• **Independent:** Age, income, chronic conditions, accessibility, campaign timing
• **Target Groups:** Elderly (60+), children (under 12), vulnerable populations

### Government Response Integration (Week 11)
• **Incorporate government data** (expected response by November 9)
• **Refine models** with official vaccination records
• **Validate findings** against government data

## Phase 3: Analysis & Recommendations (Weeks 12-13)

### Core Analysis
• **Effectiveness assessment:** Compare vaccination rates vs. infection/hospitalization rates
• **Targeting optimization:** Focus on high-risk groups (chronic conditions, family history)
• **Resource allocation:** Optimal site placement and campaign timing

### Expected Deliverables
• **2,500-3,000 word research report**
• **3-5 evidence-based policy recommendations**
• **Mathematical model demonstrating data-driven approach benefits**

## Key Research Areas
• **School program effectiveness:** Compare schools with high vs. low vaccination uptake
• **Alternative administration methods:** Nasal spray vs. traditional injection acceptance
• **Targeted promotion:** Focus on vulnerable groups with chronic conditions
• **Causal inference:** Establish relationship between vaccination rates and health outcomes

## Critical Timeline Notes
• **Government enquiry deadline:** Send by October 19, 2024
• **Expected government response:** November 9, 2024 (21 calendar days)
• **Model development:** Must begin with secondary data while waiting for government response
• **Final report due:** Week 13

## Success Metrics
• Demonstrate current government approach limitations
• Provide quantitative evidence for improved targeting strategies
• Show potential impact of data-driven resource allocation
• Recommend specific policy interventions for higher participation rates
