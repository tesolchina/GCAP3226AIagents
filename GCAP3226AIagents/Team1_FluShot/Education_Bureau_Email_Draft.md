# Education Bureau Email Draft - School Vaccination Data Collection and Accountability

**To:** Access to Information Officer, Education Bureau  
**Email:** [Education Bureau Contact Email]  
**Subject:** Request for Information under Code on Access to Information: School Vaccination Data Collection and Accountability Assessment  

**Dear Access to Information Officer,**

We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. As part of our final research project, we are studying the Education Bureau's role in school-based flu vaccination programs and data governance practices, with particular focus on data collection and accountability mechanisms.

**Research Objective:** To evaluate the Education Bureau's data collection practices for school vaccination programs and assess accountability mechanisms for protecting at-risk schoolchildren.

## Priority Data Requests

### 1. **School Vaccination Data Collection Practices (2022-2024)**
- Current data collection methods and frequency for school vaccination programs
- School participation rates in vaccination programs by district and school type
- Parent consent rates and refusal reasons (anonymized data)
- School accountability mechanisms and reporting requirements

### 2. **School Incentive and Support Programs**
- School incentive programs for vaccination promotion and participation
- Resource allocation for school vaccination programs by district
- Support provided to schools for vaccination program implementation
- Training and capacity building for school staff on vaccination promotion

### 3. **Parent Education and Communication Strategies**
- Parent education materials and communication strategies about vaccination
- Parent engagement methods and feedback collection processes
- Communication channels used to reach parents about vaccination programs
- Parent concerns and barriers to vaccination (if documented)

### 4. **School Performance and Accountability Metrics**

   - What accountability mechanisms exist for schools with low vaccination participation?
   - How is school vaccination data used to inform policy decisions?

2. **School Support and Resources:**
   - What resources are provided to schools for vaccination program implementation?
   - How does the Education Bureau support schools in promoting vaccination to parents?
   - What training and capacity building is provided to school staff?
   - How are schools held accountable for vaccination promotion efforts?

3. **Parent Engagement and Communication:**
   - How does the Education Bureau communicate vaccination information to parents?
   - What parent education materials and strategies are used?
   - How are parent concerns and barriers to vaccination addressed?
   - What feedback mechanisms exist for parent input on vaccination programs?

4. **Performance Evaluation and Improvement:**
   - How does the Education Bureau evaluate school vaccination program effectiveness?
   - What performance metrics are used to assess school vaccination promotion?
   - How are schools with low vaccination rates identified and supported?
   - What improvement strategies are implemented for underperforming schools?
