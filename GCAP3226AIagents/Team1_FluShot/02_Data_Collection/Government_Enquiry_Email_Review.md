# Government Enquiry Email Review & Revision

## Student's Original Email Analysis

### Strengths of the Original Email:
1. **Clear structure** with numbered data requests
2. **Academic context** properly established
3. **Specific data categories** requested
4. **Professional tone** and format
5. **Reference to Code on Access to Information**

### Areas for Improvement:

#### 1. **Timeline Specificity Issues**
- **Problem:** Requests "past five years" but should focus on 2022-2024 (pre-COVID baseline + post-COVID comparison)
- **Impact:** May overwhelm government with too broad a request

#### 2. **Data Granularity Concerns**
- **Problem:** Requesting data "by district (18 districts)" may be too detailed for initial request
- **Impact:** Could lead to rejection or significant delays

#### 3. **Missing COVID-19 Context**
- **Problem:** Doesn't explicitly mention the COVID-19 impact research focus
- **Impact:** Government may not understand the research significance

#### 4. **Contact Information Issues**
- **Problem:** Only one student name provided, but this is a group project
- **Impact:** May cause confusion about project scope

#### 5. **Data Availability Assumptions**
- **Problem:** Assumes all requested data exists in the requested format
- **Impact:** May lead to rejection if data doesn't exist in specified format

## Detailed Comments on Each Section

### Subject Line
**Original:** "Request for Information under the Code on Access to Information: Flu Vaccination Campaign Data Analysis"
**Comment:** Good, but could be more specific about the COVID-19 impact focus.

### Introduction
**Comment:** Well-written, but could emphasize the COVID-19 impact research angle more clearly.

### Data Requests
**Comment:** Too broad and detailed. Should prioritize the most essential data first.

### Purpose Statement
**Comment:** Good, but could be more specific about the research objectives.

## Revised Email Version

**To:** Access to Information Officer, Department of Health  
**Subject:** Request for Information under Code on Access to Information: Flu Vaccination Data Analysis Post-COVID-19

**Dear Access to Information Officer,**

We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. As part of our final research project, we are studying the impact of COVID-19 on public attitudes toward flu vaccination and the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns in Hong Kong.

**Research Objective:** To evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced flu vaccination rates and public health outcomes, with particular focus on children and elderly populations.

## Priority Data Requests

### 1. **Vaccination Coverage Trends (2022-2024)**
- Annual flu vaccination rates by age group (children 6 months-18 years, elderly 65+, healthcare workers)
- Monthly vaccination data for 2023-2024 flu season
- Comparison of pre-COVID (2019) vs. post-COVID vaccination rates

### 2. **School Vaccination Program Effectiveness**
- Participation rates in school-based flu vaccination programs
- Vaccination rates by school district/region
- Parent consent rates and refusal reasons (if available)

### 3. **Health Outcomes Data**
- Flu infection rates among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations
- Hospitalization rates due to flu complications by vaccination status
- Age-specific flu-related hospitalizations

### 4. **Campaign Resources and Promotion**
- Budget allocation for flu vaccination promotion
- Types of promotional activities conducted
- Target audience reach and engagement metrics

## Specific Questions
1. What data-driven criteria are used to determine vaccination site locations and resource allocation?
2. How has the COVID-19 pandemic influenced flu vaccination campaign strategies?
3. What measures are taken to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination promotion activities?

## Data Usage
All requested data will be used exclusively for academic research to:
- Assess the impact of COVID-19 on flu vaccination attitudes
- Evaluate the effectiveness of current vaccination campaigns
- Develop evidence-based policy recommendations

## Timeline
We understand that data compilation may take time. We would appreciate any available data by **November 9, 2024**, to allow for proper analysis and report completion.

## Contact Information
**Primary Contact:** [Team Leader Name]  
**Email:** [Team Email]  
**Institution:** Hong Kong Baptist University  
**Course:** GCAP3226 - Data-Driven Government  
**Supervisors:** Dr. Talia Wu (Mathematics), Dr. Simon Wang (English)

We are happy to provide additional clarification or modify our request based on data availability. Please let us know if any of the requested information is not available or requires alternative approaches.

Thank you for your assistance in supporting our research on public health policy effectiveness.

**Sincerely,**  
GCAP3226 Team 1 - Flu Vaccination Research Project
