I am reaching out to gather information regarding the flu vaccination program, particularly in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on public attitudes towards vaccination.

We would appreciate your responses to the following inquiries:

1. Promotion of Flu Vaccination:

   * What initiatives are currently in place to promote flu vaccination among children?
   * How do you engage schools and parents to encourage participation in the vaccination program?
2. Vaccination Statistics:

* How many children have received the flu vaccine this year?
* What percentage of the eligible child population does this represent?

1. Flu Cases and Hospitalizations:

* How many children have contracted the flu during the current vaccination program?
* What is the number of children who required hospitalization due to flu-related complications this year?

1. Comparative Data:

* If available, could you provide data on flu vaccination rates and flu cases from previous years, particularly before the COVID-19 pandemic?

Your insights will be invaluable for understanding the current public attitudes toward flu vaccination and the effectiveness of the promotional strategies employed.
