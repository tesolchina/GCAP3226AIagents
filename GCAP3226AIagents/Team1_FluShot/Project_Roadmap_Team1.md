**Specific Focus Areas:**
- Vaccination coverage patterns across demographics
- Campaign effectiveness and resource allocation
- Policy intervention impact assessment
- Predictive modeling for future campaigns

## Detailed Project Timeline (Weeks 8-13) - UPDATED

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Research (Weeks 8-9) - CURRENT PHASE

#### Week 8: URGENT - Government Enquiry & Secondary Data Collection (October 19, 2024)
**CRITICAL TASKS:**
- **SEND government enquiry email TODAY** to Department of Health under Code on Access to Information
- Begin intensive secondary data collection from data.gov.hk, Census Department, Center for Health Protection
- Design survey questionnaire for field data collection (target: parents/elderly)
- Conduct literature review on flu vaccination effectiveness and policy studies

**Government Enquiry Template:**

**Government Enquiry Template:**
> **Subject:** Request for Information under the Code on Access to Information: Flu Vaccination Campaign Data Analysis
> 
> **To:** Access to Information Officer, Department of Health
> 
> **Dear Access to Information Officer,**
> 
> We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. As part of our final project, we are studying the decision-making processes related to flu vaccination campaign planning and resource allocation.
> 
> Under the principles of the Code on Access to Information, we would be grateful if you could provide us with the following information:
> 
> 1. What specific quantitative data points (e.g., demographic vaccination rates, campaign effectiveness metrics, resource allocation data) were used to inform the planning of the 2023-2024 flu vaccination campaign?
> 2. Could you provide any public reports or policy documents that outline the standard operating procedures for determining vaccination site locations and resource allocation?
> 3. What data-driven criteria are used to evaluate the success of flu vaccination campaigns and inform future planning?

**Deliverable:** Copy of sent email with timestamp and preliminary bibliography of at least 10 secondary sources.

#### Week 9: Field Surveys & Data Analysis (While waiting for government response)
**Tasks:**
- Conduct fieldwork at vaccination centers and community locations (with permission)
- Administer surveys to parents and elderly populations
- Analyze available secondary data from public sources
- Begin preliminary data analysis and model design

**Actionable Instructions:**
- Search for flu vaccination data on data.gov.hk
- Collect demographic data from Census and Statistics Department
- Review Department of Health annual reports and press releases
- Create shared document to log all sources
- Begin mathematical model framework design

**Deliverable:** Field survey results and preliminary analysis of secondary data.

### Phase 2: Mathematical Modeling (Weeks 10-11)

#### Week 10: Model Development & Government Response Integration
**Tasks:**
- Develop mathematical model for optimal vaccination campaign planning
- Clean dataset and run preliminary model with available data
- Document assumptions, variables, and methodology
- **Expected government response arrives (November 9, 2024)**

**Regression Model Approach:**
- **Dependent Variable:** Vaccination rates by district/demographic group
- **Independent Variables:** Age distribution, income levels, accessibility to vaccination sites, campaign timing, resource allocation
- **Analysis:** Identify key factors affecting vaccination uptake

**Simulation Model Approach:**
- **System Definition:** Hong Kong vaccination campaign infrastructure
- **Variables:** Population demographics, vaccination site capacity, campaign duration, resource constraints
- **Scenarios:** Different resource allocation strategies, campaign timing options, target population prioritization

**Deliverable:** Preliminary model results and draft methodology section.

#### Week 11: Data Integration & Model Refinement
**Tasks:**
- Integrate government response data into models
- Refine models with official vaccination records
- Compare current government vaccination campaign practices with model results
- Identify gaps between current approach and data-driven optimization

**Deliverable:** Refined model results and comparative analysis summary.

### Phase 3: Reporting & Finalization (Weeks 12-13)

#### Week 12: Drafting Recommendations & Report Writing
**Tasks:**
- Formulate 3-5 concrete, evidence-based recommendations
- Each team member writes assigned section (~500 words each)
- Ensure recommendations address identified gaps

**Sample Recommendations:**
1. "Implement regression-based demand forecasting using demographic and seasonal data to optimize vaccination site placement and resource allocation"
2. "Develop simulation models to test different campaign timing strategies and resource allocation scenarios before implementation"
3. "Establish data-driven criteria for evaluating campaign effectiveness and adjusting future strategies"

**Deliverable:** Complete first draft of entire group report.

#### Week 13: Final Review & Submission
**Tasks:**
- Edit entire report for consistency, clarity, and tone
- Check grammar, citations, and formatting
- Ensure cohesive narrative flow
- Final proofread and submission
- Prepare presentation materials

**Deliverable:** 2,500-3,000 word group research report.

## Critical Timeline Notes
- **Government enquiry deadline:** Send by October 19, 2024 (TODAY)
- **Expected government response:** November 9, 2024 (21 calendar days)
- **Model development:** Must begin with secondary data while waiting for government response
- **Final report due:** Week 13

## Group Collaboration Framework

### Team Roles (5-6 members)
- **Project Manager:** Tracks deadlines, schedules meetings, main contact with supervisors
- **Lead Researcher - Primary Data:** Manages government enquiry process and correspondence
