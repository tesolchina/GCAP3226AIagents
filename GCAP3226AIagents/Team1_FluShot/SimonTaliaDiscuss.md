Simon H WANG
Yeah, okay, so let's brainstorm a little bit about the project on flu shot participation. So actually, we, you know, I work with some students or myself, I've published some letters in such an audience about this, this topic. But at the time, we only requested data from the Department of Health. We didn't do any advanced math modeling or analysis. So it's it's like being counting, but in terms of the general background, the issue here is basically participation rate. So I think the participation rate overall is quite low because we don't just look at the absolute number. The absolute number actually just increasing. If you look at, for example, compare the figure of 2017, and earlier years, there's an increase in terms of the absolute number of people who join the program. But if you look at the eligible people and then you calculate the percentage, you can see that the participation rate is not very high. Exact figure, I'm not sure, but we can check. So one thing we can do is to request more recent data to look at how many people, or what's the percentage of people who are eligible for this kind of program. Because there are, like, over 60 years old, the elderly eligible for some programs, and then there's the children under 12, they're also eligible for subsidies or something. But then we also don't know how many people who are not eligible for the subsidized program actually pay and take the shots. So that's actually the missing, missing data. But then I think the Department of Health actually is collecting or monitoring the influenza breakout or outbreak through some kind of channels and sampling, I don't think they would have like been able to collect every single cases but, but they do monitor certain clinics. I don't know whether it's public or private. That would help them to get an understanding of the current development of the what we call this is a contagious or communicative disease, right? So we can also look at those data. They probably publish it on a weekly or monthly basis, but we can also request so in other words, we have the we have the for flu shots data, how many people, even perhaps age groups, who got the protection. And we may also have the data in terms of afterwards, during the peak season, how many people actually got the disease, and also severe severity. We may have data regarding how many people get hospitalized because of flu, at least for the public hospital. We don't know. We don't know whether we can get this kind of data. So the immediate question would become, to what extent this kind of flu shots or vaccination program can actually make a difference or prevent or lower the outbreak, or lower the infection and and I think that's a very important data for for the government to decide in terms of resource allocation, right? So, so presumably, there's always this trade off, right? Because the most ideal scenario would be bringing more resources, even like make a require, make it a requirement, just like the covid. But then, of course, that may not worth the while, because the mod at the marginal level, on the margin, if you increase the participation rate further, you may not be able to lower the infection rate. So, but that's an empirical question, right? We don't know what's the relationship between the vaccination rate on the one hand and infection rate on the other. And also we want to take into consideration the age group, right? There's always the more vulnerable groups. And also, whether we have the data about the infection rate among different age groups, we don't know. And there's also this issue about weather, right? Because if there's a particularly cold weather of that season, then there will be more infections, and that's obviously something we cannot control. So it could be the case that a particular year, the infection rate is not very high. It may not because of the vaccination problem. It's probably because just the weather is not so bad. So so there's different factors we want to take into consideration it become a very complex picture. Yeah, this

Talia Wu
is about causal inference, which is really difficult. We want to only focus on the causal relationship between the vaccine and the say how many hospitalization due to flu can be avoided.

Simon H WANG
But then there's another consideration, which is we know that the Department of Health states are working with education Bureau to reach out to local schools. Yeah, we, I received the notice, yeah, the consent form, right? Um, so another possibility for the students project is to investigate that particular program to see to what extent that program is successful, whether or not the Reach Out program, outreach program, actually make a difference on the vaccination rate. But, I mean, I'm just brainstorming, because we haven't reached to the stage start selecting the models or methodology, but because, at the more fundamental level, our project is about looking at a specific government decision and policy related to flu shots and to see whether or not a more data driven approach can help the decision makers or the government staff to make better decisions. Right? So in that regard, we need to first look at some specific decisions. Another area we might explore is whether nasal sprayer, sprayer, nasal sprayer, which is a different way of administering the shots, could make a difference. But again, we don't know whether we can find this kind of data, because presumably that spray thing would be more expensive, but less invasive, but less invasive, and maybe the parents or people would be more willing to take the shots or take the vaccine. But then again, whether the government is actually sponsoring or subsidizing this kind of alternative way to administer the vaccines. That can be another area to look into. But I guess we have to start thinking about what are the most kind of feasible way to find a focus, and also what is the most appropriate or relevant the math models that we can apply. I topic.

Talia Wu
There are two like two topics. The first is the effectiveness of the vaccine program of reducing the hospitalization rate due to Another is the alternative

Simon H WANG
solution to administer the vaccine. Why? See,

right?

Talia Wu
I think, based on, based on my little bit searching, on consensus, if I only search Hong Kong and the flu vaccine, many of the existing studies are about the influencing factors of the willingness of certain group of people to accept this vaccination. Okay, so they are using the survey to study what kind of factors will influence and also identify those barriers for different groups. This is for children, for school program, this is for adults. This is for specific group of even the healthcare workers themselves have a relative low like

Simon H WANG
winning this, yeah,

Talia Wu
to get the shot. And this is another vulnerable group of your pregnant woman. This is another perspective the student may try to find out the reason why people don't want to get the shot.

Simon H WANG
It's interesting, because I don't know whether the education bureau or the Department of Health would collect data about infection rates on a school based because that could be a good kind of assessment. Imagine if we can compare the groups with high uptake of the shots versus schools with fewer school children taking the shots, and if evidence suggests that there will be fewer infection cases after, if there's more people taking the shots, then that can be a very strong piece of evidence trying to convince people next year to join, to join the program. But, um, but, but again, it's, it's about data governance, because, because I don't think the education Bureau and the Department Health is actually collecting this kind of data, but then we need to start thinking, if we're able to, because it comes to comes down to the issue of the effectiveness of the vaccination itself. I heard there's some studies suggesting the effectiveness, effective rate is about 60% 60% that low? Yeah, it's not guaranteed. It's not guaranteed at all.

Talia Wu
How is this calculated?

Simon H WANG
You can go back to the literature. There's some literature. There are some studies on this. It's definitely not 100%

Talia Wu
but I thought this should be higher, like

Simon H WANG
I saw some figures, maybe, maybe you can, you can double check, and also, um, back in

Talia Wu
reduce the risk. The risk. It's not like the incidence rate, it's the risk.

Simon H WANG
You mean the fatality, but, but the influenza is not, the fatality is not really, it's not very, not very high anyway, right? So I don't know how they calculate the the effectiveness, because, because there's always this, this gamble, right? When whoever make this vaccine, they have to gamble which which strands of the virus is going to they're going to fight against so and I think back back in one of the letters, I actually mentioned a study in Ontario Canada. They did a universal program. Yeah, so, so, so there's, there's some data indicating the impact of the universal, I couldn't remember which, which, probably the most recent one. You go back to go go down, go back, go to go to that letter and go down. Not, probably not this one.

Yeah, in 2000 well, but I didn't put the link here. They didn't put the link here, but, but, but there is a universal research I need to find that. I think the I probably put a link there, but I didn't in my submission. But, anyway, um, so, so I think we need to move on to the next topic. But do you have any initial thoughts on in terms of model, in terms of what, what students can focus on?

Talia Wu
I think even if we found that for a school, or for some school with higher percentages of taking medicine, the like, the hospitalization rate is lower compared to those schools with lower percentages. Still not a causal inference. There might be many confounding variables, right?

Simon H WANG
Oh, another thing that that I find very interesting and could be promising is, what if the hospital, I mean, the Hospital Authority and Department of Health, start looking at the health records like E house, and then identify the more vulnerable groups with pre existing conditions or certain conditions that could be more vulnerable to the virus, and targeting those people For promotion.

Talia Wu
This is this is good. So the question is whether they do it in this way or not.

Simon H WANG
The I think the question is, if we target these people, it could be a simulation. So it's like, if we target these people and increase the participant rate or vaccination rate of this particular group, would the outcome be better? So so we're not, we're not looking at the infection rate of the general population. We start looking at the infection rate of specific groups of people with certain existing conditions or whatever, and because those vulnerable groups, they're more likely to not just get infected, they can develop into more severe conditions, right? So, I mean, I guess the in terms of policy recommendation, I think what the government should do is to target those people, because I'm working on my own GE course, and they are looking at the chronic condition. There's a chronic care for hyper hypertension, for screening of hypertension and diabetes. So again, they're trying to do the conversion in general. And anyone over 45 without the condition diagnosed can join the program. But the position rate is very low. It's only about 10% so we are, we are also exploring the possibility of, what if the Hospital Authority or Department of Health start looking into people's family members? Because the public hospital, they know everybody who got hypertension and diabetes they have, they have a name list, and then they all know their family members, because, because that diabetes could be genetically related, right? So if we start targeting the family members of the patients, that could be a higher risk of of groups, and they could better benefit from the screening program than the general population. So, so that sounds a very promising approach. But now with with our toolkits in modeling, you know whether it's regression or simulation, whether we can, you know, just use some some quantitative reasoning to to explore this and gain more insights. That will be, that will be something we have to consider. Because, in my course, we don't, we don't do math, and all we do, we just ask the relevant authority, maybe explore the feasibility of doing this kind of promotion, but in Hong Kong, we have this privacy concern and everything. So even this idea, it may not be feasible, they may not be willing to do that. So so we haven't figured out how to develop the argument, but it sounds like a pretty promising thing to do.

Talia Wu
I think even for individual doctor, if they can access the like the history of that patient, and when the patient goes to see the doctor, and doctor can suggest him to participate in such program. I think this is the same as if there is a like database, and the meaning of that database send the information to all people that fulfill certain requirements. Say they have, they already have certain chronic disease, then send this message to promote the program to specific group. Then, why privacy? Why so called privacy issues here? Yeah, and to be honest, I think this is very logic, to allocate the resource to the target group rather than to that general population.

Simon H WANG
It makes a lot of sense, but but the challenge in the context of our course is how we can build certain math model or reasoning to develop an argument or to collect data or evidence to convince people right because, because you can't just throw out or float an idea that sounds very promising, we Need more solid evidence, even if the lawmakers or whoever is willing to consider our proposal, they can't just make the suggestion based on intuition. This is more like

Talia Wu
Bayes rule, so you have a prior probability of accepting the suggestion to to get the flu vaccine or to participate in the chronic disease care program. And we have a further information that this person has the has this disease, has the Chronicle disease, which is more vulnerable to the virus. Then, given this additional information, what is the probability that he or she will take our suggestion to get the flu shot or go to participate in that program? We can do the simple calculation. So without any background, the probability of receiving that information is is, say, only 5% but with the additional information, and if we assume that for those vulnerable groups, they they realize that if they, if they got the shot, they can be they can be protected. We have a we can calculate the posterior probability. If it turns out to make the probability of receiving that service higher, then we can say that maybe focus on the target group is helpful. It's like a probability calculation.

Simon H WANG
But how can we get a data? Do? Can we find it, locate, I mean, collect some data to to run this.

Talia Wu
We can, we can

Simon H WANG
through survey, or

Talia Wu
yes, just ask. Just ask to them whether they have that disease. And given that they have the disease, what is the percentage of whether they want to participate in the program? Like,

this is the first time I think think of it in this way, yes,

if we have the we want to know so a yes, given that it is a say patient, We need the probability of say yes

and patient, therefore

we'll have a table. This is patient, not patient?

Yes, no, and we just count, count the number of people. ABCD,

in general, the proportion of Say Yes will be divided

Speaker 1
by A

Talia Wu
and within the patient, if you only consider about a patient, we focus on this column, and within this column, we want to know whether more people are more willing to the probability. Of saying yes. So it's like a divided by a plus c within the patient. How many of them say yes? So a divided by a plus c. So if this is greater than this, given that it is a patient, it is more likely that they will say, Yes, that is worth doing. Okay.

Simon H WANG
But how do you get the data to test this? You just ask them,

Talia Wu
yeah, we ask we just like, survey 100 people and and for each of them, we put them into these four cells. And this ABCD just represents the number of people who fall into this cells. And if it turns out that in general public, the probability of saying yes, so that is this role, right? A plus B divided by the total number of people, this is in general population, probability of Yes. And then we found that within the patient, the proportion of saying yes is higher. Then we should focus on the patient, right?

Simon H WANG
Okay, I think the same approach could be applied to assess low income and high income, or because, because, like, for the screening, yeah, I'm thinking about the screening of the chronic condition, like diabetes. So if we look at two different groups, like low income versus middle class, and to see, because the intuition would be the low income people would be more willing to join this kind of program that that would provide subsidies, because if, if it turns out that diagnosis suggests you have this condition, then you can get subsidies to see a private doctor to get treatment. But the challenge of that program is that even if you join the program to see the private doctors, it will still be more expensive than seeing public clinic doctors, because there will be some restriction like certain drugs, or if there's some other conditions related to this condition, and the doctors prescribe drugs for those conditions or whatever, they won't get subsidies. So, so I think that's one of the problem with with the program, and maybe even explain why the participation rate is low, because for low income people, they probably still want to go to see the public clinic doctor instead of private doctor through the through the subsidy scheme. But what I'm saying is that we can look at the specific factors or variables associated with people and try to differentiate different groups. And then take this approach to to assess similarly, we can ask like between the typical like the more conventional shot, the needle versus nasal spray, right? And ask whether there would be but again, the thing is, it might be simply confirming the intuition, right, but I assume this approach would be able to help us to build a more rigorous argument.

Talia Wu
Yeah, I'm thinking whether the result, if it turns out this, this conditional probability, is indeed higher than this. Can I? Can I say that which we should focus on this group. What's the correct interpretation?

Simon H WANG
Okay, so maybe, maybe we spend a little bit more time talking about.
