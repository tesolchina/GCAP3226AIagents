Dear KMB and Citybus teams,

I am a student at Hong Kong Baptist University studying the course 'Empowering Citizens through Data: Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong'. We are writing to seek clarification regarding service planning and coordination where your routes overlap.

After our research, we have observed that KMB route 272A and Citybus route 582 share eight overlapping stops. In light of this, could you please advise on the following:

### Government approval basis

1. From your perspective as franchised operators, on what criteria and data does the Government base its approval for the operation of a bus route?

2. What information do you typically provide to the Government during route proposal or review (e.g., demand analysis, coverage gaps, headway/capacity, road space/environmental considerations)?

3. If available, please point us to any public guidelines or documents that set out these criteria.

### Overlapping stops and consultation

4. When bus stops and routing are set up or adjusted, has the Government considered the potential issues arising from multiple routes sharing a significant number of stops?

5. To what extent do you discuss and coordinate with the Government (and with each other) on stop placement, overlap management, and stop rationalisation?

### Headway coordination and passenger waiting time

6. We have noticed that the two routes often arrive in close succession at the overlapping stops, which does not shorten average passenger waiting time. Do you currently coordinate timetables or stagger headways on the overlapping section?

7. What measures (e.g., dispatching controls, holding strategies, timetable adjustments) are used to reduce bunching and improve the effective combined frequency for passengers?

### Your internal criteria for new routes and stop planning

8. What criteria do you consider when planning new routes and determining bus stop locations (e.g., passenger demand, stop spacing and safety, accessibility, interchange connectivity, operational constraints)?

9. Are there internal planning guidelines you can share, or summaries of how these criteria were applied to routes 272A and 582?

If helpful, we can provide the list of the eight overlapping stops we identified for your verification. We would also appreciate any data or references (e.g., scheduled headways, load factors, corridor-level assessments) relevant to the overlapping section, and information on any planned reviews or adjustments.

Thank you for your attention. We look forward to your response and are happy to discuss further.

Yours faithfully,
