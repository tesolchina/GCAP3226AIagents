# Topic 3: Bus Routes Coordination - Mathematical Models Application

## Overview
This document explores how regression analysis and simulation models can be applied to bus routes coordination problems, building on the existing simulation framework in our course materials.

## 1. Regression Models for Bus Routes Coordination

### 1.1 Predicting Passenger Demand
**Regression Application:**
- **Dependent Variable**: Passenger arrival rate (λ) at each bus stop
- **Independent Variables**: 
  - Time of day
  - Day of week
  - Weather conditions
  - Special events
  - Population density around stops
  - Distance to major destinations (MTR stations, shopping centers)

**Example Model:**
```
λᵢ = β₀ + β₁(Hour) + β₂(DayType) + β₃(Weather) + β₄(PopDensity) + εᵢ
```

### 1.2 Bus Utilization Prediction
**Regression Application:**
- **Dependent Variable**: Bus utilization percentage
- **Independent Variables**:
  - Route segment
  - Time since departure
  - Previous stop boarding/alighting
  - Historical demand patterns

### 1.3 Travel Time Estimation
**Regression Application:**
- **Dependent Variable**: Segment travel time
- **Independent Variables**:
  - Traffic conditions
  - Number of stops
  - Passenger load
  - Weather conditions
  - Road characteristics

## 2. Simulation Models for Bus Routes Coordination

### 2.1 Current Simulation Framework Analysis
Based on the existing Route 56 simulation in our materials, we have:

**Key Components:**
- **Poisson Distribution**: Models passenger arrivals at stops
- **Binomial Distribution**: Models passenger alighting behavior
- **Queue Management**: Tracks waiting passengers at each stop
- **Real-time Tracking**: Updates bus positions and passenger loads

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
simulationData = {
    forward: {
        stops: [...],
        stopLambdas: [0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 0, 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        alightProbabilities: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.15, 0.08, 0.07, 0.27, 0.56, 1.0],
        utilization: [4.69, 7.01, 13.95, 37.16, 37.16, 35.64, 31.47, 31.25, 29.06, 21.24, 9.38, 0.00]
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Enhanced Simulation for Route Coordination

**Multi-Route Coordination Simulation:**
1. **Route Intersections**: Model passenger transfers between routes
2. **Service Frequency Optimization**: Test different headway combinations
3. **Dynamic Scheduling**: Adjust departures based on real-time demand
4. **Resource Allocation**: Optimize bus assignments across routes

**Mathematical Models in Simulation:**
- **Passenger Flow**: P(transfer) = f(wait_time, destination_distance)
- **Service Level**: SL = f(wait_time, crowding, reliability)
- **Cost Function**: C = f(fuel, labor, maintenance, passenger_time_value)

## 3. Integrated Approach: Regression + Simulation

### 3.1 Predictive Simulation Framework
```
Step 1: Use regression to predict demand patterns
Step 2: Feed predictions into simulation model
Step 3: Test coordination scenarios
Step 4: Optimize based on performance metrics
```

### 3.2 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Passenger Wait Time**: Average and 95th percentile
- **Bus Utilization**: Percentage capacity usage
- **Service Reliability**: On-time performance
