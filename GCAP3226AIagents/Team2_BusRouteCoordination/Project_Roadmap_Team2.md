## Core Research Question
**Primary Question:** To what extent does the Hong Kong Transport Department use data-driven approaches in bus route coordination and frequency optimization?

**Specific Focus Areas:**
- Bus frequency optimization and passenger demand prediction
- Route coordination strategies to minimize wait times
- Impact of external factors (weather, events) on ridership
- Optimal balance between service frequency and operational costs

## Detailed Project Timeline (Weeks 5-13)

### Phase 1: Planning & Initial Data Collection (Weeks 5-7)

**Government Enquiry Template:**
> **Subject:** Request for Information under the Code on Access to Information: Bus Route Coordination and Frequency Optimization
> 
> **To:** Access to Information Officer, Transport Department
> 
> **Dear Access to Information Officer,**
> 
> We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. As part of our final project, we are studying the decision-making processes related to bus route coordination and frequency optimization.
> 
> Under the principles of the Code on Access to Information, we would be grateful if you could provide us with the following information:
> 
> 1. What specific quantitative data points (e.g., passenger demand patterns, route performance metrics, coordination algorithms) are used to inform bus frequency and route coordination decisions?
> 2. Could you provide any public reports or policy documents that outline the standard operating procedures for bus route optimization and frequency adjustments?
> 3. What data-driven criteria are used to evaluate the effectiveness of bus route coordination and inform future planning?

**Deliverable:** Submit one-page project plan and draft enquiry email to supervisors for feedback.

#### Week 6: Fieldwork & Primary Data Request (No Class)
**Tasks:**
- Send approved enquiry email to Transport Department
- Begin intensive secondary data collection
- Conduct fieldwork at bus stops (with permission)
- Analyze existing Route 56 simulation framework

**Actionable Instructions:**
- Search for transportation data on data.gov.hk
- Collect Octopus card transaction data (if available)
- Review Transport Department annual reports
- Analyze existing simulation materials in course folder
- Create shared document to log all sources

**Deliverable:** Copy of sent email with timestamp and preliminary bibliography of at least 10 secondary sources.

#### Week 7: Data Consolidation & Model Selection
**Tasks:**
- Organize all collected secondary data
- Review any response from Transport Department
- Decide on mathematical model (Regression or Simulation)

**Model Choice Justification:**
- **Choose Regression** if focusing on predicting passenger demand based on time, weather, events, or demographic factors
- **Choose Simulation** if modeling complex bus route coordination scenarios, passenger flow optimization, or multi-route coordination strategies

**Deliverable:** One-paragraph justification for model choice, submitted to Dr. Wu for approval.

### Phase 2: Modelling & Analysis (Weeks 8-10)

#### Weeks 8-9: Building "The Ideal" Scenario
**Tasks:**
- Develop mathematical model for optimal bus route coordination
- Extend existing Route 56 simulation framework
- Document assumptions, variables, and methodology

**Regression Model Approach:**
- **Dependent Variable:** Passenger demand, bus utilization rates, wait times
- **Independent Variables:** Time of day, weather conditions, special events, demographic factors
- **Analysis:** Identify key factors affecting bus service efficiency

**Simulation Model Approach:**
- **System Definition:** Multi-route bus coordination system
- **Variables:** Passenger arrival patterns, bus capacity, route overlap, coordination algorithms
- **Scenarios:** Different coordination strategies, frequency adjustments, route optimization

**Deliverable:** Preliminary model results and draft methodology section.

#### Week 10: Synthesizing Reality & Ideal
**Tasks:**
- Compare current Transport Department practices with model results
- Identify gaps between current approach and data-driven optimization
- Analyze potential consequences of current limitations

**Deliverable:** Bullet-point summary of comparative analysis.

### Phase 3: Reporting & Finalization (Weeks 11-13)

#### Week 11: Drafting Recommendations & Report Writing
**Tasks:**
- Formulate 3-5 concrete, evidence-based recommendations
- Each team member writes assigned section (~500 words each)
- Ensure recommendations address identified gaps

**Sample Recommendations:**
1. "Implement regression-based demand forecasting to optimize bus frequency and reduce passenger wait times by 15-25%"
2. "Develop simulation models for multi-route coordination to improve service efficiency and passenger experience"
3. "Establish data-driven criteria for real-time route adjustments based on passenger demand and external factors"

**Deliverable:** Complete first draft of entire group report.

#### Week 12: Peer Review, Editing & Consolidation
**Tasks:**
- Edit entire report for consistency, clarity, and tone
- Check grammar, citations, and formatting
- Ensure cohesive narrative flow

**Deliverable:** Near-final version of report, ready for final proofread.

#### Week 13: Final Submission
**Tasks:**
- Final proofread and submission
- Prepare presentation materials

**Deliverable:** 2,500-3,000 word group research report.
