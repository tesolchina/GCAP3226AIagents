# Team 2: API Data Collection - Overview for Students

## üìã **Important Note for Students**
**You are NOT expected to write or run the code in this folder.** This folder contains technical implementation details for reference and understanding. Your role is to:

1. **Understand the overall workflow** and data collection approach
2. **Reflect on the methodology** and its implications for your research
3. **Use the insights** to inform your project analysis and recommendations
4. **Focus on the research questions** rather than technical implementation

## üéØ **Purpose of This Folder**
This folder contains the technical framework for collecting and analyzing real-time bus data to support your research on bus route coordination. The files here demonstrate how data can be collected from Hong Kong's open data APIs to answer your research questions.

### **2. Research Methodology**
- **Primary Data Sources:** Direct API access to real-time bus data
- **Secondary Analysis:** Comparison of different routes and coordination approaches
- **City-wide Analysis:** Identification of similar cases across Hong Kong
- **Impact Assessment:** How coordination decisions affect passenger experience

### **3. Key Research Questions Addressed**
- **What decisions does TD make** about coordinating overlapping routes?
- **What data is available** to inform these decisions?
- **How do coordination decisions** affect passenger experience?
- **What are the consequences** of current coordination approaches?

## üìä **Data Sources Available**

### **Citybus Real-time Data**
- **Source:** [data.gov.hk Citybus API](https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/ctb-eta-transport-realtime-eta)
- **Data:** Real-time arrival times, route information, stop data
- **Update Frequency:** Every 1 minute
- **Relevance:** Provides data for Citybus route 582

### **KMB/LWB Real-time Data**
- **Source:** [data.gov.hk KMB API](https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-td-tis_21-etakmb)
- **Data:** Real-time arrival times, route information, stop data
- **Update Frequency:** Every 1 minute
- **Relevance:** Provides data for KMB route 272A

## üéØ **Your Research Focus**

### **Primary Research Questions**
1. **What specific decisions does the Transport Department make regarding coordination of overlapping routes from different operators?**
2. **What data does the Transport Department have access to for making coordination decisions?**
