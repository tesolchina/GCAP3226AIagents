# Team 2: Similar Cases Analysis - Bus Route Coordination

## Project Overview
**Objective:** Identify and analyze similar cases of overlapping bus routes from different operators across Hong Kong
**Target:** Routes with significant overlaps (5+ stops) between different operators
**Methodology:** Data-driven analysis using Hong Kong Government Open Data APIs

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Route Overlap Identification Criteria

#### Primary Criteria
- **Minimum Overlap:** 5+ consecutive or non-consecutive overlapping stops
- **Different Operators:** Routes operated by different companies (KMB, Citybus, New World First Bus)
- **Service Frequency:** Regular service routes (not special or limited service)
- **Geographic Coverage:** Routes serving similar areas or corridors

#### Secondary Criteria
- **Passenger Volume:** High passenger volume routes
- **Peak Hour Service:** Routes with significant peak hour service
- **Transfer Connections:** Routes serving as transfer points
- **Service Reliability:** Routes with consistent service patterns

### 2. Data Collection Strategy

#### Phase 1: City-wide Route Analysis
- [ ] **Complete Route Database:**
  - Collect all KMB routes and stops
  - Collect all Citybus routes and stops
  - Collect all New World First Bus routes and stops
  - Create comprehensive route-stop database

#### Phase 2: Overlap Detection Algorithm
- [ ] **Stop Matching Analysis:**
  - Identify routes with common stops
  - Calculate overlap percentages
  - Rank routes by overlap significance
  - Filter for different operator combinations

#### Phase 3: Similar Cases Identification
- [ ] **High-Overlap Routes:**
  - Routes with 5+ overlapping stops
  - Different operator combinations
  - Various coordination strategies
  - Geographic distribution analysis

### 3. Target Analysis Areas

#### High-Overlap Route Categories

##### 1. Cross-Harbor Routes
- **KMB Routes:** Routes connecting Kowloon and Hong Kong Island
- **Citybus Routes:** Routes connecting Kowloon and Hong Kong Island
- **Overlap Potential:** High due to limited crossing points

##### 2. Airport/Transportation Hub Routes
- **KMB Routes:** Routes serving airport and major transportation hubs
- **Citybus Routes:** Routes serving airport and major transportation hubs
- **Overlap Potential:** High due to concentrated passenger demand

##### 3. University/Education Routes
- **KMB Routes:** Routes serving major universities and educational institutions
- **Citybus Routes:** Routes serving major universities and educational institutions
- **Overlap Potential:** High due to concentrated student population

##### 4. Business District Routes
- **KMB Routes:** Routes serving Central, Admiralty, Tsim Sha Tsui business districts
- **Citybus Routes:** Routes serving Central, Admiralty, Tsim Sha Tsui business districts
- **Overlap Potential:** High due to concentrated business activity

### 4. Data Collection Plan

#### API Data Collection
```python
# Example implementation for city-wide route analysis
def collect_all_routes():
    """
    Collect all routes from all operators
    """
    # KMB routes
    kmb_routes = collect_kmb_all_routes()
    
    # Citybus routes  
    citybus_routes = collect_citybus_all_routes()
    
    # New World First Bus routes (now integrated with Citybus)
    nwfb_routes = collect_nwfb_all_routes()
    
    return {
        "kmb": kmb_routes,
        "citybus": citybus_routes,
        "nwfb": nwfb_routes
    }
```

#### Overlap Detection Algorithm
```python
def detect_route_overlaps(route1, route2):
    """
    Detect overlaps between two routes
    """
    # Get stops for both routes
    stops1 = get_route_stops(route1)
    stops2 = get_route_stops(route2)
    
    # Find common stops
    common_stops = set(stops1) & set(stops2)
    
    # Calculate overlap metrics
    overlap_percentage = len(common_stops) / min(len(stops1), len(stops2))
    overlap_count = len(common_stops)
    
    return {
        "common_stops": list(common_stops),
        "overlap_count": overlap_count,
        "overlap_percentage": overlap_percentage
    }
```

### 5. Analysis Categories

#### Category 1: High-Overlap Routes (10+ stops)
- **Analysis Focus:** Routes with extensive overlaps
- **Coordination Potential:** High potential for coordination
- **Passenger Impact:** Significant impact on passenger experience
- **Examples:** [To be identified through analysis]

#### Category 2: Medium-Overlap Routes (5-9 stops)
- **Analysis Focus:** Routes with moderate overlaps
- **Coordination Potential:** Moderate potential for coordination
- **Passenger Impact:** Moderate impact on passenger experience
- **Examples:** [To be identified through analysis]

#### Category 3: Low-Overlap Routes (3-4 stops)
- **Analysis Focus:** Routes with limited overlaps
- **Coordination Potential:** Limited potential for coordination
- **Passenger Impact:** Limited impact on passenger experience
- **Examples:** [To be identified through analysis]

### 6. Coordination Strategy Analysis

#### Current Coordination Approaches
- [ ] **No Coordination:** Routes operate independently
- [ ] **Informal Coordination:** Routes coordinate through operator agreements
- [ ] **Formal Coordination:** Routes coordinate through government oversight
- [ ] **Integrated Coordination:** Routes coordinate through unified management

#### Coordination Effectiveness Assessment
- [ ] **Passenger Waiting Time:** Impact on average waiting times
- [ ] **Service Reliability:** Impact on service consistency
- [ ] **Operational Efficiency:** Impact on operational costs
- [ ] **Passenger Satisfaction:** Impact on passenger experience
