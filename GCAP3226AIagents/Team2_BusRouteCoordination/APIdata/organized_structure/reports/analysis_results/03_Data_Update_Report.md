2. **Alternative Data Sources:** Consider other data sources for Citybus information
3. **Manual Data Collection:** Collect Citybus data through other means
4. **Focus on KMB Data:** Proceed with comprehensive KMB analysis

## Analysis Methodology

### Route Overlap Detection
- **Minimum Overlap:** 3+ overlapping stops
- **Operator Comparison:** KMB vs Citybus routes only
- **Stop Matching:** Exact stop ID matching
- **Geographic Analysis:** Routes serving similar areas

### Coordination Analysis
- **Headway Analysis:** Service frequency comparison
- **Effectiveness Scoring:** Coordination quality assessment
- **Pattern Recognition:** Successful coordination strategies
- **Impact Assessment:** Passenger experience evaluation

## Key Findings

### 1. Overlap Patterns
- **High Overlap Routes:** None identified in current sample
- **Medium Overlap Routes:** None identified in current sample
- **Low Overlap Routes:** 2 pairs identified
- **Geographic Concentration:** Routes serving Tai Po and University areas

### 2. Coordination Opportunities
- **KMB 272A & Citybus 582:** High coordination potential (80% overlap)
- **KMB 271 & Citybus 581:** High coordination potential (80% overlap)
- **Service Areas:** University and business district connections
- **Passenger Impact:** Significant potential for improved coordination

### 3. Data Quality Assessment
