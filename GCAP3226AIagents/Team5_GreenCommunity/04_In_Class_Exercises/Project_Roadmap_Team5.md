- Community-based environmental initiative success factors

## Detailed Project Timeline (Weeks 5-13)

### Phase 1: Planning & Initial Data Collection (Weeks 5-7)

#### Week 5: Project Scoping & Planning (Current Week)
**Tasks:**
- Finalize research question and scope
- Assign team roles (see Section 3)
- Draft enquiry email to Environmental Protection Department under Code on Access to Information
- Begin analysis of existing Green @ Community program data

**Government Enquiry Template:**
> **Subject:** Request for Information under the Code on Access to Information: Green @ Community Program Data and Evaluation
> 
> **To:** Access to Information Officer, Environmental Protection Department
> 
> **Dear Access to Information Officer,**
> 
> We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. As part of our final project, we are studying the decision-making processes related to Green @ Community program design, implementation, and evaluation.
> 
> Under the principles of the Code on Access to Information, we would be grateful if you could provide us with the following information:
> 
> 1. What specific quantitative data points (e.g., program participation rates, environmental impact metrics, resource allocation data) are used to inform Green @ Community program decisions?
> 2. Could you provide any public reports or policy documents that outline the standard operating procedures for Green @ Community program evaluation and improvement?
> 3. What data-driven criteria are used to assess the effectiveness of Green @ Community programs and inform future program development?

**Deliverable:** Submit one-page project plan and draft enquiry email to supervisors for feedback.

#### Week 6: Fieldwork & Primary Data Request (No Class)
**Tasks:**
- Send approved enquiry email to Environmental Protection Department
- Begin intensive secondary data collection
- Conduct fieldwork at Green @ Community sites (with permission)
- Analyze existing Green @ Community program materials

**Actionable Instructions:**
- Search for environmental and community data on data.gov.hk
- Collect Green @ Community program data
- Review Environmental Protection Department annual reports
- Analyze existing Green @ Community program materials from course
- Create shared document to log all sources

**Deliverable:** Copy of sent email with timestamp and preliminary bibliography of at least 10 secondary sources.

#### Week 7: Data Consolidation & Model Selection
**Tasks:**
- Organize all collected secondary data
- Review any response from Environmental Protection Department
- Decide on mathematical model (Regression or Simulation)

**Model Choice Justification:**
- **Choose Regression** if focusing on predicting program effectiveness based on demographic factors, resource allocation, or community characteristics
- **Choose Simulation** if modeling complex community engagement scenarios, resource allocation optimization, or program implementation strategies

**Deliverable:** One-paragraph justification for model choice, submitted to Dr. Wu for approval.

### Phase 2: Modelling & Analysis (Weeks 8-10)

#### Weeks 8-9: Building "The Ideal" Scenario
**Tasks:**
- Develop mathematical model for optimal Green @ Community program design
- Clean dataset and run model
- Document assumptions, variables, and methodology

**Regression Model Approach:**
- **Dependent Variable:** Program effectiveness, community participation rates, environmental impact
- **Independent Variables:** Demographics, income levels, education, accessibility, program design
- **Analysis:** Identify key factors affecting Green @ Community program success

**Simulation Model Approach:**
- **System Definition:** Community environmental program system
- **Variables:** Population demographics, program participation, resource allocation, environmental impact
- **Scenarios:** Different program strategies, resource allocation options, community engagement approaches

**Deliverable:** Preliminary model results and draft methodology section.

#### Week 10: Synthesizing Reality & Ideal
**Tasks:**
- Compare current Green @ Community program practices with model results
- Identify gaps between current approach and data-driven optimization
- Analyze potential consequences of current limitations

**Deliverable:** Bullet-point summary of comparative analysis.

### Phase 3: Reporting & Finalization (Weeks 11-13)

#### Week 11: Drafting Recommendations & Report Writing
**Tasks:**
- Formulate 3-5 concrete, evidence-based recommendations
- Each team member writes assigned section (~500 words each)
- Ensure recommendations address identified gaps

**Sample Recommendations:**
1. "Implement regression-based program effectiveness prediction models to optimize resource allocation and improve community engagement"
2. "Develop simulation models for program scenario testing to identify optimal implementation strategies"
3. "Establish data-driven criteria for program evaluation and continuous improvement"

**Deliverable:** Complete first draft of entire group report.

#### Week 12: Peer Review, Editing & Consolidation
**Tasks:**
- Edit entire report for consistency, clarity, and tone
- Check grammar, citations, and formatting
- Ensure cohesive narrative flow

**Deliverable:** Near-final version of report, ready for final proofread.

#### Week 13: Final Submission
**Tasks:**
- Final proofread and submission
- Prepare presentation materials

**Deliverable:** 2,500-3,000 word group research report.

## Group Collaboration Framework

### Team Roles (5-6 members)
