## Core Research Question
**Primary Question:** To what extent does the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department use data-driven approaches in municipal solid waste charging policy design and implementation?

**Specific Focus Areas:**
- Waste generation patterns and charging policy impacts
- Policy effectiveness and compliance rates
- Predictive models for waste reduction
- Optimal pricing and implementation strategies

## Detailed Project Timeline (Weeks 5-13)

### Phase 1: Planning & Initial Data Collection (Weeks 5-7)

#### Week 5: Project Scoping & Planning (Current Week)
**Tasks:**
- Finalize research question and scope
- Assign team roles (see Section 3)
- Draft enquiry email to Environmental Protection Department under Code on Access to Information
- Begin analysis of existing waste charging policy data

**Government Enquiry Template:**
> **Subject:** Request for Information under the Code on Access to Information: Municipal Solid Waste Charging Policy Data
> 
> **To:** Access to Information Officer, Environmental Protection Department
> 
> **Dear Access to Information Officer,**
> 
> We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. As part of our final project, we are studying the decision-making processes related to municipal solid waste charging policy design and implementation.
> 
> Under the principles of the Code on Access to Information, we would be grateful if you could provide us with the following information:
> 
> 1. What specific quantitative data points (e.g., waste generation rates, compliance metrics, policy impact assessments) are used to inform municipal solid waste charging policy decisions?
> 2. Could you provide any public reports or policy documents that outline the standard operating procedures for waste charging policy evaluation and adjustment?
> 3. What data-driven criteria are used to assess the effectiveness of waste charging policies and inform future policy development?

**Deliverable:** Submit one-page project plan and draft enquiry email to supervisors for feedback.

#### Week 6: Fieldwork & Primary Data Request (No Class)
**Tasks:**
- Send approved enquiry email to Environmental Protection Department
- Begin intensive secondary data collection
- Conduct fieldwork at waste collection points (with permission)
- Analyze existing waste charging policy materials

**Actionable Instructions:**
- Search for environmental data on data.gov.hk
- Collect municipal waste collection data
- Review Environmental Protection Department annual reports
- Analyze existing waste charging policy materials from course
- Create shared document to log all sources

**Deliverable:** Copy of sent email with timestamp and preliminary bibliography of at least 10 secondary sources.

#### Week 7: Data Consolidation & Model Selection
**Tasks:**
- Organize all collected secondary data
- Review any response from Environmental Protection Department
- Decide on mathematical model (Regression or Simulation)

**Model Choice Justification:**
- **Choose Regression** if focusing on predicting waste generation based on demographic factors, pricing, or policy interventions
- **Choose Simulation** if modeling complex waste charging policy scenarios, behavioral responses, or implementation strategies

**Deliverable:** One-paragraph justification for model choice, submitted to Dr. Wu for approval.

### Phase 2: Modelling & Analysis (Weeks 8-10)

#### Weeks 8-9: Building "The Ideal" Scenario
**Tasks:**
- Develop mathematical model for optimal waste charging policy design
- Clean dataset and run model
- Document assumptions, variables, and methodology

**Regression Model Approach:**
- **Dependent Variable:** Waste generation rates, compliance rates, policy effectiveness
- **Independent Variables:** Demographics, income levels, pricing, accessibility, education
- **Analysis:** Identify key factors affecting waste charging policy success

**Simulation Model Approach:**
- **System Definition:** Waste management system with charging policies
- **Variables:** Population demographics, waste generation patterns, pricing, compliance behavior
- **Scenarios:** Different pricing strategies, implementation approaches, policy interventions

**Deliverable:** Preliminary model results and draft methodology section.

#### Week 10: Synthesizing Reality & Ideal
**Tasks:**
- Compare current waste charging policy practices with model results
- Identify gaps between current approach and data-driven optimization
- Analyze potential consequences of current limitations

**Deliverable:** Bullet-point summary of comparative analysis.

### Phase 3: Reporting & Finalization (Weeks 11-13)

#### Week 11: Drafting Recommendations & Report Writing
**Tasks:**
- Formulate 3-5 concrete, evidence-based recommendations
- Each team member writes assigned section (~500 words each)
- Ensure recommendations address identified gaps

**Sample Recommendations:**
1. "Implement regression-based waste generation prediction models to optimize charging rates and improve policy effectiveness"
2. "Develop simulation models for policy scenario testing to identify optimal implementation strategies"
3. "Establish data-driven criteria for policy evaluation and continuous improvement"

**Deliverable:** Complete first draft of entire group report.

#### Week 12: Peer Review, Editing & Consolidation
**Tasks:**
- Edit entire report for consistency, clarity, and tone
- Check grammar, citations, and formatting
- Ensure cohesive narrative flow

**Deliverable:** Near-final version of report, ready for final proofread.

#### Week 13: Final Submission
**Tasks:**
- Final proofread and submission
- Prepare presentation materials

**Deliverable:** 2,500-3,000 word group research report.
