### Step 3: Give Instructions to AI Agent

Example prompt:

```
I want to analyze air quality data to understand pollution patterns in Hong Kong.

INPUT:
Dataset URL: https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-epd-airteam-air-quality-health-index
Description: Real-time Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) for different areas

PROCESS:
Please:
1. Access this dataset and find the API
2. Write Python code to fetch current AQHI data

## üí° Tips for Success

### Finding Good Datasets

‚úÖ **Look for datasets with:**
- API access (easier to work with)
- Regular updates (more current)
- Good documentation
- Relevance to your policy question

‚ùå **Avoid datasets that:**
- Only have PDF downloads
- Haven't been updated in years
- Lack clear descriptions
- Have complex authentication

### Writing Good Instructions

‚úÖ **Be specific about:**
- What data you need
- What visualizations you want
- What format you prefer
- Your end goal (report, presentation, etc.)

‚ùå **Don't be vague:**
- "Get some data"
- "Make a chart"
- "Analyze stuff"

### Working with AI Agents

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Provide the exact dataset URL
- Explain your policy question
- Ask for executable code
- Request visualizations
- Specify output formats

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Assume the AI knows which dataset
- Skip explaining your goal
- Forget to ask for visualization
- Ignore error messages

## üîß Technical Tips

### Understanding API Parameters

Most DATA.GOV.HK APIs use similar patterns:

```python
# Common parameter patterns
params = {
    'date': '2025-10-13',      # Date filter
    'district': 'Central',      # Location filter
    'lang': 'en',              # Language
    'format': 'json'           # Response format
}
```

### Handling API Responses

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)
data = response.json()

# Check status
if data.get('status') == 1:
    # Success - process data
    process_data(data)
else:
    # Error - show message
    print(f"Error: {data.get('message')}")
```

### Creating Visualizations

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Simple bar chart
df.plot(kind='bar', x='category', y='value')
plt.title('My Analysis')
plt.savefig('output.png')
plt.show()
```
