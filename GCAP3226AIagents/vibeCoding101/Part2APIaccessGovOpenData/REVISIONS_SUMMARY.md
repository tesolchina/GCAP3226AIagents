### Cell 1: Package Installation
```python
!pip install requests matplotlib pandas seaborn -q
```

### Cell 2: Fetch Real-Time Data
```python
# Executable code that fetches MTR train data
# Shows train arrivals in real-time
# Displays DOWN and UP direction trains
```

### Cell 3: Create Visualizations
```python
# Generates 2 charts:
# 1. Bar chart of train arrival times
# 2. Direction comparison chart
# Uses matplotlib for visualization
```

### Cell 4: Multi-Station Comparison
```python
# Compares 4 different stations
# Creates bar chart comparison
# Shows service frequency differences
```

### Cell 5: Learning Outcomes
- Explains what students learned
- Points to template files
- Encourages exploration

**Also Created**: `mtr_visualization.py`
- Advanced visualization script
- Multiple chart types (bar, pie, comparison)
- Saves PNG files

### 2. Interactive Learning
**Before**: Static code examples in files
**After**: Executable cells in notebook with live visualizations

### 3. Visualization Focus
**Before**: Text output only
**After**: Multiple charts showing data patterns

### 4. Dataset Exploration Guide
**Before**: Only MTR example
**After**: Comprehensive guide to 30+ datasets

### 5. Emphasis on AI Assistance
**Before**: "Here's how to code"
**After**: "AI writes code for you - here's how to ask"

## 📈 Learning Outcomes Enhanced

Students now learn:

1. ✅ **How to structure requests** (INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE.md)
2. ✅ **How to run code in Jupyter** (executable cells)
3. ✅ **How to create visualizations** (chart examples)
4. ✅ **How to explore datasets** (EXPLORE_OTHER_DATASETS.md)
5. ✅ **How to work with AI agents** (throughout all materials)

**Core Message**: You don't need to be a programmer—you need to communicate clearly with AI agents!
