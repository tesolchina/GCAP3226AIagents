# 🎯 Your Project - API Data Access Template

## Welcome to Your Project Workspace!

This is where **YOU** will build your own data access project for your GCAP3226 group assignment.

---

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Choose Your Dataset
1. Visit [DATA.GOV.HK](https://data.gov.hk/en-datasets)
2. Browse by category (Transportation, Environment, Health, etc.)
3. Find a dataset relevant to your policy question
4. Make sure it has an API or downloadable data

### Step 2: Complete the Instruction Template
1. Open `project_instructions.md` in this folder
2. Fill in the template with your chosen dataset
3. Write clear instructions for the AI agent
4. Specify what analysis you want

### Step 3: Let AI Generate Your Code
1. Copy your completed instructions
2. Ask the AI agent to generate code based on your instructions
3. The AI will create Python scripts for you
4. Review and test the generated code

### Step 4: Organize Your Files
Save your project files in this folder:
- `your_api_test.py` - Your main API access script
- `your_analysis.py` - Your data analysis code
- `your_output.json` - Output data
- `your_report.md` - Your findings
- `your_visualization.py` - Charts and graphs (optional)

## 📁 Files in This Folder

### 📄 Templates (Fill these in!)
- **project_instructions.md** - Template for your AI instructions
- **project_plan.md** - Planning template for your project
- **data_dictionary.md** - Template to document your data

### 💻 Dummy Code Files (Replace with your real code!)
- **sample_api_access.py** - Example structure for API access
- **sample_analysis.py** - Example structure for analysis
- **requirements.txt** - Python packages needed

### 📊 Output Placeholders
- **output/** - Folder for your output files

## 🎓 Important Reminders

### You DON'T Write the Code!
❌ Don't manually write hundreds of lines of code  
✅ Write clear instructions and let AI generate the code

### What You DO:
1. ✅ Choose your dataset
2. ✅ Write clear instructions
3. ✅ Review AI-generated code
4. ✅ Test and validate
5. ✅ Analyze results
6. ✅ Document findings

### What AI Does:
1. 🤖 Reads API documentation
2. 🤖 Generates Python code
3. 🤖 Creates visualizations
4. 🤖 Writes helper functions
5. 🤖 Handles errors
6. 🤖 Formats output

## 💡 Example Workflow

### 1. You Write Instructions
```markdown
I need to access the Air Quality data from DATA.GOV.HK.
Dataset URL: https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-epd-xxx

Please:
1. Read the API documentation
2. Create Python code to fetch air quality data for the past week
3. Generate visualizations showing PM2.5 levels
4. Create a summary report
```

### 2. AI Generates Code
The AI will create:
- `air_quality_api.py` - API access code
- `air_quality_viz.py` - Visualization code
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- Output files

### 3. You Review and Use
- Test the code
- Analyze results
- Write your policy analysis
- Include in your report

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: What if my dataset doesn't have an API?**  
A: Many datasets provide CSV downloads. AI can help you write code to download and process CSV files too!

**Q: What if I don't understand the code AI generates?**  
A: Ask the AI to explain each part! Request comments and documentation.

**Q: Can I use multiple datasets?**  
A: Yes! Just provide instructions for each dataset.

**Q: How do I know if my instructions are good?**  
A: Use the INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE.md as a guide. Be specific about inputs and desired outputs.

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your project should:
- ✅ Access real Hong Kong government data
- ✅ Have working Python code (AI-generated)
- ✅ Produce meaningful output
- ✅ Include visualizations (if applicable)
- ✅ Be documented clearly
- ✅ Answer your policy question

---

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

1. Open `project_instructions.md`
2. Follow the template
3. Ask AI to help you!

**Remember**: The goal is to learn how to collaborate with AI agents to access and analyze data, not to become expert programmers overnight!
