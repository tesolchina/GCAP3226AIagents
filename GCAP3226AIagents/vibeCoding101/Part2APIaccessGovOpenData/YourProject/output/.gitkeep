# Output Folder

This folder is where your generated data files, reports, and visualizations will be saved.

## What Goes Here

### Data Files
- `raw_data_[timestamp].json` - Raw data from API
- `processed_data_[timestamp].csv` - Cleaned/processed data
- `summary_stats.json` - Statistical summaries

### Reports
- `analysis_report.txt` - Main analysis findings
- `data_quality_report.txt` - Data validation results

### Visualizations
- `chart_[name].png` - Generated charts
- `figure_[name].png` - Generated figures

## Notes

- Files are automatically timestamped
- AI-generated code will save output here
- Keep this folder organized as files accumulate
- You can create subfolders (e.g., `output/charts/`) if needed

## Placeholder

This `.gitkeep` file ensures the output folder exists in version control even when empty.

Delete this file after you start generating real output files.
