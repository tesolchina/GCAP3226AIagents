I want to analyze:
1. [Analysis goal 1]
   Example: Compare PM2.5 levels between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island
   
2. [Analysis goal 2]
   Example: Identify peak pollution hours
   
3. [Analysis goal 3]
   Example: Calculate correlation with temperature
```

### Step 4: Visualizations
```
Please create the following visualizations:

Chart 1: [Type of chart] showing [what data]
Example: Bar chart showing average air quality by district

Chart 2: [Type of chart] showing [what data]
Example: Line chart showing PM2.5 trends over time

Chart 3: [Type of chart] showing [what data]
Example: Heatmap showing pollution levels by hour and day
```

### Step 5: Output Files
```
Please generate:
- [ ] JSON file with processed data
- [ ] CSV file with summary statistics
- [ ] Text report with findings
- [ ] PNG files with visualizations
- [ ] README explaining how to run the code
```

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Python Version
- [ ] Python 3.8+
- [ ] Any version is fine

### Required Libraries (that I know of)
- [ ] requests (for API access)
- [ ] pandas (for data processing)
- [ ] matplotlib (for visualizations)
- [ ] Other: ___________

**Note**: The AI agent will suggest additional libraries if needed!

### Data Constraints
- Time period: [e.g., Last 3 months, Year 2024, etc.]
- Geographic scope: [e.g., All Hong Kong, Specific districts, etc.]
- Data size: [Any limits?]

## üìù Specific Instructions for AI

### Data Collection
```
[Be very specific about what data you want]

Example:
"Please fetch air quality data for the following stations:
- Central, Hong Kong Island
- Mong Kok, Kowloon
- Tuen Mun, New Territories

For each station, get hourly PM2.5 readings for October 2024."
```

### Analysis Details
```
[Explain exactly what you want to learn from the data]

Example:
"I want to know:
1. Which station has the worst air quality on average?
2. What time of day typically has the highest pollution?
3. Is there a difference between weekdays and weekends?
4. Are there any noticeable patterns or trends?"
```

### Output Format
```
[Specify how you want the results presented]

Example:
"Please organize the output as:
1. A summary JSON file with key statistics
2. Individual CSV files for each station
3. A markdown report with:
   - Executive summary
   - Key findings (bullet points)
   - Detailed analysis
   - Recommendations
4. Visualization PNGs saved in an 'images' folder"
```

```

### What I Need Explained
```
[What do you want AI to explain in detail?]

Example:
"Please explain:

- What each visualization shows
- How to modify the code to use different date ranges"
```

### Potential Challenges
```
[Any concerns or known issues?]

Example:
"The API might be slow or rate-limited.
Please include retry logic and error handling."
```
