# Advanced Instruction File - Generated by AI

**Note**: This advanced instruction file was created by asking AI to expand on a simple instruction. Students can ask AI to generate similar detailed instructions rather than writing them manually.

Input: /workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/Team1_FluShot

Process: 
Analyze the Team1_FluShot project comprehensively:
1. Understand the main policy issue and research questions
2. Identify current data and data gaps
3. Determine relevant government departments (Department of Health, Centre for Health Protection, etc.)
4. Draft a detailed enquiry strategy with priorities and justifications
5. Create a sample enquiry letter template
6. Include context that this is a GCAP3226 student project focused on flu vaccination strategy

Output: /workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/vibeCoding101/Part1ReadingEditingFiles/planGovEnquiries_Advanced.md

Format the output as:
- Project Summary
- Data Requirements (current vs needed)
- Enquiry Strategy by department with priorities
- Draft letter template
- Timeline for follow-up

## How This Was Created

Instead of writing this complex instruction manually, you can ask AI:

```
"Please create a detailed instruction file for analyzing Team1_FluShot 
and generating a government enquiry plan. Include:
- Multiple analysis steps
- Specific departments to consider
- Output format requirements
- Context about the GCAP3226 course
Save it as InstructionsSample_Advanced.md"
```

**Key Lesson**: Let AI help you create complex instruction files! You just need to describe what you want, and AI can generate the detailed instructions.
