# Part 1 Instruction Files - Summary

## ðŸ“¦ What Was Created

We've created a comprehensive learning package for Part 1 of the Vibe Coding Tutorial:

### File Structure
```
Part1ReadingEditingFiles/
â”œâ”€â”€ GUIDE.md                      # Complete learning roadmap (READ FIRST!)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                     # Concept explanation and usage guide
â”œâ”€â”€ InstructionsSample.md         # Detailed working example
â”œâ”€â”€ TEMPLATE_InstructionFile.md   # Blank template for students
â”œâ”€â”€ planGovEnquiries.md          # Output file (generated by AI)
â””â”€â”€ FILE_SUMMARY.md              # This file - overview
```

**What's inside**:
- Structured sections to fill in
- Placeholders with guidance
- Examples of good practices
- Checklists

**How to use**:
```
1. Copy the template to a new file

```

---

### 5. planGovEnquiries.md (The Output)
**What it is**: File that will be generated by AI when following InstructionsSample
**Who uses it**: Students - review AI's work
**What's inside** (after generation):
- Analysis of flu vaccination project
- Identified data gaps
- Suggested government departments to contact
- Draft enquiry strategy

**How to use**:
```
After AI completes InstructionsSample, ask:
"Show me planGovEnquiries.md and explain your analysis"
```

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Objectives Achieved

### By Using These Files, Students Will:

1. **Understand structured AI communication**
   - Why instruction files are better than ad-hoc prompts
   - How to break down complex tasks
   - Importance of clear specifications

2. **Practice professional documentation**
   - Writing clear, structured instructions
   - Specifying inputs, processes, and outputs
   - Providing context and requirements

3. **Develop file system literacy**
   - Navigating workspace folders
   - Using absolute file paths
   - Managing input/output files

4. **Gain AI collaboration skills**
   - Effective prompting strategies
   - Iterative refinement
   - Quality control of AI output

5. **Connect to government enquiry writing**
   - Both require clarity and structure
   - Both need context and justification
   - Both benefit from systematic approach

## ðŸ“š How These Files Work Together

### The Learning Flow:

```
GUIDE.md (Read first)
    â†“
    Provides roadmap and sequence
    â†“
README.md (Read second)
    â†“
    Explains concepts and benefits
    â†“
InstructionsSample.md (See example)
    â†“
    AI follows â†’ creates planGovEnquiries.md
    â†“
Students review output and learn from example
    â†“
TEMPLATE_InstructionFile.md (Practice)
    â†“
Students create their own instruction files
    â†“
Apply to other team projects and tasks
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Pedagogical Insights

### Why This Approach Works:

1. **Progressive Learning**
   - Start with concepts (GUIDE, README)
   - See an example (InstructionsSample)
   - Practice yourself (TEMPLATE)

2. **Learning by Doing**
   - Not just reading about instruction files
   - Actually creating and using them
   - Seeing real outputs

3. **Transferable Skills**
   - Instruction files â†’ government enquiries
   - Both require clear communication
   - Professional writing practice

4. **Documentation Practice**
   - Creating reusable instructions
   - Building a portfolio of work
   - Collaborative potential

## ðŸ”— Integration with Jupyter Notebook

### How These Files Connect to the Tutorial:

The main Jupyter notebook (`vibe_coding_tutorial.ipynb`) now:
- References this folder in the introduction
- Guides students to read GUIDE.md first
- Walks through using InstructionsSample.md
- Encourages creating custom instruction files
- Shows example code blocks of what AI generates
- Connects to reflective essay requirements

---

## âœ… Success Criteria

Students have successfully completed Part 1 when they can:
- [ ] Explain what instruction files are and why they're useful
- [ ] Navigate the workspace using file paths
- [ ] Read and understand InstructionsSample.md
- [ ] Successfully have AI follow InstructionsSample.md
- [ ] Review and critique planGovEnquiries.md
- [ ] Create their own instruction file using the template
- [ ] Apply instruction files to other projects
- [ ] Reflect on how this relates to government enquiries

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps After Part 1

Students should:
1. Complete the Part 1 reflection questions
2. Save their custom instruction files
3. Move to Part 2 (APIs) with instruction file mindset
4. Consider using instruction files throughout the tutorial
5. Apply this method to their group projects

---

## ðŸ“Š Assessment Connection

## ðŸŽ“ Pedagogical Alignment

### Connection to GCAP 3226 Goals:

| Course Goal | Part 1 Files Support |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Data-informed policymaking | Systematic analysis through instruction files |
| Transparency & accountability | Documented, reproducible processes |
| Effective communication | Clear instruction writing practice |
| AI tools utilization | Structured AI collaboration |
| Citizen empowerment | Understanding information access |

---

**The Part 1 files create a complete, self-contained learning module that teaches students a fundamental skill: how to communicate effectively with AI agents through structured instruction files.**

**This skill directly transfers to writing government enquiries, which is the focus of Reflective Essay 2! ðŸŽ¯**
