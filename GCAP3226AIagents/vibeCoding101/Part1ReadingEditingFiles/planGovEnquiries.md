# Plan for Government Enquiries: Team 1 Flu Shot Campaign Analysis

## Objective
To obtain missing data required for analyzing flu vaccination coverage, campaign effectiveness, and policy interventions in Hong Kong.

## Key Data Gaps
- Vaccination rates by age, eligibility, and payment status
- Hospitalization rates due to flu (by age group)
- Infection rates by school (to assess outreach program effectiveness)
- Uptake and subsidy status of alternative vaccine administration (e.g., nasal spray)
- Weather data for correlation with infection rates

## Departments to Contact & Enquiry Focus

### 1. Department of Health
- Vaccination rates (by age, eligibility, payment status)
- Hospitalization and infection rates
- Campaign effectiveness metrics
- Data on alternative vaccine administration (nasal spray)

### 2. Education Bureau
- School-based vaccination rates
- School-based infection rates
- Outreach program effectiveness

### 3. Hospital Authority
- Hospitalization data due to flu (by age group, severity)

### 4. Hong Kong Observatory
- Weather data for correlation analysis

## Enquiry Strategy
- Draft formal requests under the Code on Access to Information
- Specify quantitative data points needed for analysis
- Request data from recent years (e.g., 2023-2024 campaign)
- Ask for breakdowns by age, eligibility, payment, and school
- Request information on data collection methods and limitations
