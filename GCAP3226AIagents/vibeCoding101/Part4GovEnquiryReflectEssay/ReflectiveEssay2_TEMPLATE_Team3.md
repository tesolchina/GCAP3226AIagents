## Reflective Essay on Government Data Access and AI Support

### Introduction (30–40 words)
[Briefly situate this essay: You drafted an enquiry to the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) under the Code on Access to Information to support Team 3’s project on typhoon signal timing and emergency response. Note your role and the assignment’s goal.]

### Main Body (120–140 words)
- Data governance assessment: [What you learned about HK’s transparency; what’s open (e.g., data.gov.hk, general criteria) vs what likely needs formal request (decision logs, station-level time series during signal changes, SOPs, evaluation metrics).]
- Enquiry drafting experience: [Challenges specifying data (time windows, stations, variables), framing precise questions to avoid a “non-answer,” professional tone, Code references.]
- AI collaboration: [How the AI agent helped with structure/tone/checklist vs. customized tutor for context; what still required your judgment; skills gained.]

### Conclusion (30–40 words)
[How the requested data would strengthen your model (e.g., test the relationship between announcement lead time and accuracy using deviation-from-threshold near the decision point), backup plan if refused (public HKO data, literature, simulation), and personal takeaways.]
