- /workspaces/GCAP3226AIagents/Team[X]_[ProjectName]/Project_Roadmap_Team[X].md
- Any relevant analysis files from the team folder

## Process
1. Analyze the project to identify:
   - What data is already available (from data.gov.hk, web crawling, etc.)
   - What data is NOT publicly available but needed for the analysis
   - Which government department/bureau holds this data

2. Draft a formal enquiry email/letter that includes:
   - **Subject line**: Clear and specific
   - **Introduction**: 
     * Your name and affiliation (HKBU student, GCAP 3226 course)
     * Brief description of your research project
   - **Data Request**:
     * Specific data items needed (be precise!)
     * Preferred format (CSV, Excel, PDF report, etc.)
     * Time period covered (if applicable)
   - **Purpose**:
     * How the data will be used (academic research, policy analysis)
     * How it contributes to understanding public policy
   - **References**:
     * Mention Code on Access to Information if appropriate
     * Reference any publicly available related data
   - **Contact Information**:
     * Your email address
     * Expected response timeline (reasonable)
   - **Closing**: Professional and courteous

3. Create TWO versions:
   - **Version A**: Formal letter format (for official submission)
   - **Version B**: Email format (for online enquiry forms)

4. Add notes explaining:
   - Why this specific data is needed
   - Alternative data sources if this request is denied
   - Follow-up questions to prepare
