**Simon Wang:** Take a lot of time and effort and try to make it work. And then one of the final crucial steps is to make sure that students will you know, take this course and will be on board. So that's very challenging, which is why I think, we're very… happy and grateful that you are here, even though right now we only got 5 students, but I hope more students will join, and also we're recording this, so the first two weeks, you know, if students join later, they can refer to the video.

You know, this course is very unique. In the sense that this is a course co-hosted by Mass Department and Language Center. So, when you think about transdisciplinary, you know, cross-disciplinary collaboration, when the math teacher working with a language teacher, it's not a very common combination. You know, I taught a GCAP course before, I'm still teaching the other GCAP course. It was me with a professor from the English department, so that actually makes more sense, right? So, Ben and I were both from the language background, but this time, me and Talia, we're from very different backgrounds. And, but I think these kinds of collaboration is very important, because in the real world, you know, when you try to solve some real-world problem, you can't just rely on one set of tools. Right?

Of course, quantitative reasoning is so important these days, right? We're living in the age of big data. We are, you know, embracing AI, and AI is driven by big data. So, quantitative reasoning technologies are very important, but then at the same time, we also need humanities, we need people who can think more qualitatively, people who can write very well. So, I think that's where I come to this course, you know. I want to work with my colleague Talia, with a strong quantitative reasoning background. You know, she has a PhD in math and doing a lot of work on applying statistical models to public health. But then I also want to leverage my expertise on working with the government in the past almost 10 years.

When I say I work with the government, I'm not really kind of working with them as colleagues. You will see in a minute what do I mean by working with the government. Basically, we are… taking the sort of a citizen's role, okay? So we approach the government staff, and we try to ask questions, understand their practices in the public policy. And then we critically review their work. So that's what I mean by working with the government. So that's kind of the background here. So what we're trying to do is to… Seek some kind of synergy between a maths teacher and a language teacher. Alright, so, that's kind of the premise of… of our course.

## Accessing Course Materials

And, I'd like to invite you to come to this page. Let's see how you can come to this page. Probably the best way to go is to go to Moodle, and in fact, you should get my email, you know, in the calendar, in the Google Cal—you know, in the calendar, there's also a link. But either way, if you go to Moodle, you will find a Google Doc. Okay, so, so it's kind of, yeah, so… so if you go to Moodle, you will find the Google Docs link. So we're going to update this Moodle from time to time throughout the semester, but the best way to access all the materials is actually come to this page. This is a kind of an unremarkable page here. We're trying to figure things out, you know, basically this is a new course. This is a great opportunity for us to explore and try different things. So, and we're very happy that we got a… a pretty small class size so far. You know, we actually have 16 students enrolled, but hopefully more students will join us soon.

At any rate, so if you come to this page, you will see the first link here, which is the course hub. Alright, so this is where, I'd like to kind of just give you a little bit more background and what we're trying to do here.

## Course Title and Motivation

So the course title is Empowering Citizens Through Data, Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong. I think every single word here actually is quite important. So the fundamental motivation here is to empower citizens, all right? Because even though the word citizen implies that we are the taxpayers, we have certain political rights, we are not always feel empowered, right? Because these days, the elite, the government people, you know, the top government officials, they just do whatever they want to do. So we're trying to empower people.

But how do we do that? Well, we do it through data science, okay? That's why we have a mathematician here. Okay, so to be more specific, we try to participate in the policy analysis. So we analyze policy not just to do research or to write papers, that's usually… that's the normal, you know, the conventional way of doing things in the university is to do research and then publish papers, get more money, you know? But what we are trying to do here is to engage with the government staff in a more, kind of, close way, and in a more confrontational way, so that we can better understand the current practice of the government, but then try to offer recommendations, try to critically review what the government is trying to do in the context of data analysis, okay?

## Course Objectives and Student Discussion

So in terms of course objective, you can see that we are trying to offer a set of analytical tools to enable the so-called data-informed policy-making. Now, data-informed policy-making should be quite straightforward, right? The idea that we want to collect the data, and we want to use data to inform and to make better decisions on public policy. That, that shouldn't be, you know, surprising at all. But the difficulty here is that to what extent… the question here is, to what extent the Hong Kong government staff are doing that? Right? So, to what extent do the Hong Kong government staff actually make decisions based on data? That's the very first question we have to think about. We have to keep in mind.

So I think this is a good opportunity for you to invite some of you to talk. I have one student sitting over there, so maybe… what's your name? And, what do you think about my question?

**Eric:** My name is Eric. Do you answer my question? Okay. So, my question, again, if you don't know my question, do you know my question? Do you know my question? No? Okay. My question is, to what extent is the Hong Kong government making the decisions based on data. Does it make sense? What do you think?

**Simon Wang:** Hmm.

**Eric:** I think the government, should… look more about, advanced data, like, on the media, or they do research to look around the whole society, to get the advanced data, to implement, advanced policy to enhance the… efficiency of the entire society.

**Simon Wang:** Okay, so… you are saying that the government should use more data to make decisions, right? Okay, I agree with you. I'm sure that most of you agree, right? The government should. But my question is more like an empirical question. Everybody… we all agree that the government should. But the question is, to what extent they are doing it now? You see what I mean? Thanks.

**Bonnie:** What do you think? I think, the government used mandated. Yeah. But… About the decision, I think the data is not the most important part.

**Simon Wang:** So when you say the government uses a lot of data, where do you get the information? Where do you get the information?

**Bonnie:** Every time we have researched the… people, and environment data.

**Simon Wang:** So you, you did some research? Those organizations, they did that, and… I remember refer to the data they gave them, and sometimes, like, some over-budget something. You only used to make? What's your name?

**Bonnie:** My name is Bonnie, and… we see that some of the construction projects are sometimes over budget, but they still do it, because they think that it's good. But I don't think that it's supported by some data, but some… their vision, and yeah, they do use some data, but sometimes, some vision things are not… cannot be analyzed, because there are some future things, and, just their wish. They would like the Hong Kong to be like that, and… And, yeah, sometimes it's beneficial to us, because… is addressing some problems, currently, like, some people are poor, they are not… they have not… do not have enough money to buy a house. They would use this data to build some, public building and some… something, so, yeah, they do use it, but they mixed with some that is not about data.

**Simon Wang:** Okay, so you refer to the practice of the government, consulting the companies, right? Yeah, they do. Okay. Well… I think we need to move on, but the short answer to my question—to what extent the government is using the data to make decisions—the short answer is we don't know. Okay? We don't know. Because the government do not tell us. Right? I mean, you can probably look at the newspaper from time to time, there might be some reference to a little bit, like, consulting firms, or there could be some, you know, we do have a… you know, we do have staff, you know, handling data, but to what extent where the government is really using the data to make decisions, we don't know. You see? That's the problem. We don't know. But now, in this course, we are going to find out. Alright? We're gonna find out?

## Access to Information and Methodology

Do you know how? You only pass the mic over to Talia. Good rules, yeah, yeah. Oop! Okay, so here's the second question. Suppose we don't know to what extent the government is using data to make decisions? We need to find out. How are we gonna do that?

**Eric:** Just, look at the government's policy to know that do the government use the data to… using the policy to make, makes Hong Kong be better or not.

**Simon Wang:** Go to the government website, right? Are you saying, okay, go to the government website. Go to the legislative council website. So those are the reports you can find, right? Well, of course, that's something we can do. You can go to different departments, you know, legislative council, they all got reports. And in the report, you may be able to see here and there, talking about to what extent they use data. But now, in this course, we're going to take a different approach, and I think this is a very fresh approach. Okay, unless you took my other GCAP course, you probably don't know this approach. It's called Code on Access to Information. Okay? Have you heard of that? Code on Access to Information? From time to time, you will watch it on the, on the street, or there's… could be on TV. It's called *Gong Hau Jiu Siu Sa*. Have you heard of it? Alright. So, in English, it's called Access to Information. Now, we are going to use this code and to… ask questions. We're going to send the questions directly to the department, to the specific department in the Hong Kong government, and ask them. The basic question is just the first question I raised: to what extent does the government… to what extent is your department using data to make decisions. All right? That's a very general question, but when you contextualize it, when you adapt this question to a specific problem or policy, it becomes a host of new questions that you have to ask. Alright?

And we have to be hurried. Because this semester, you know, every semester we've only got 13 weeks. But do you know how long it would take for the government to reply to us when you send off the… question? So suppose today, 2nd of September, you sent 3 questions, or 5 questions, to the Department of Health. How long do you think they will get back to you? Huh? Right, 3 weeks is the standard, kind of, expected time frame, alright? 3 weeks is the calendar week, okay? So, in other words, if you… if you send a request right before the Christmas break, you know, that means they have more work to do. Anyway, 3 weeks is the normal time frame under the Code of Access to Information. But then they can, under so-called exceptional circumstances, they can extend it to another 7 weeks. Okay? So that means… We need to be prepared for that kind of scenario. Alright, so maybe today, you send the questions, 7 weeks later, you will get the results. That's already, like, half of the semester gone, you see what I mean? So one way to… avoid this kind of a situation is try to break down your inquiry into a smaller number of questions. Okay, because usually you ask a lot of questions, they will say, oh, we need more time to process. But if you treat it like a separate application, then they have to do it. You see what I mean? I feel like that's a… that's a little trick. Anyway, let's see, right, so very quickly, let me finish talking about objective.

## Course Goals and Argument Building

So we are trying to offer some tools for… To, practice the data analytics. And we are trying to figure out there could be a better way for the government to do things. Alright, so after we got the information from the government regarding their practices, we are going to say, look, there's actually a better way to do this. And this is how… this is where Talia will come in. Because she got the background, she knows how to do math. And we are going to propose a better way to solve this problem by using data, by using math. Alright? And this is how we're going to build the argument, okay? This is very important. We're going to make this argument. The argument is, this is how the government is currently doing things. Okay, that's what we find out. And then… with the data we got… and with the math model and analytics, we propose that this is the better way to do things. Everybody can benefit. But the government… the government staff have to do things differently. That's our argument. We hope we can make that argument strong. And then we're going to… send the report to the lawmakers. Alright? Because the lawmakers are supposed to be the gatekeepers, right? So they approve all the funding requests, they're supposed to monitor the performance of the government staff. Alright, so that's, that's a very important part.

Talia, do you want to quickly talk about some math tools that can make this happen? Okay. Alright? So, I think I pretty much covered the course objective, right? So the key thing is to evaluate the government staff's practices of policy analysis and policy making. And to see to what extent the data is playing a role. Our initial impression is that only to a limited extent the government is using the data. So, we have a mission. Alright? So all the students taking this course, we are, as a team, we are on a… on a mission. Our mission is to find out to what extent the government is using the data to make decisions, and most likely, the answer would be quite disappointing, and therefore, we are going to do research, we're going to do math model to show people, to make the argument that, actually, the government can do a better job. Okay? So it won't be a happy story for the government. You see what I mean? But it's going to be an important argument for our society. Because the message is clear: if we want better decisions, better policies, we have to adopt the data-driven approach. And this is what this course is about.

## Tentative Roadmap and Workload

Alright? Now, in terms of… Well, we have the assessment part, and then if you click on this, we got a roadmap. So, yeah, I don't want to spend too much time here because, you know, Talia has got other things to cover as well. I have something to cover as well, something more specific. But, this is basically a kind of like a tentative plan, you know, as I said earlier, this is the first time we teach this course. We're trying to set things up and figure things out, so please be patient with us. But, as you can see, we got the course instruction, this week, and then we will start learning some AI tools, and learning some, like, Jupyter notebooks, using Python to… to, learn how to visualize things. And, we will start picking up the topics and form groups in week 3, because that's the end of the add-drop period, and and we will have good consultation, we will go to the field. You know, we'll try to collect some data. For example, one of the projects we're going to work on is about the bus frequency, right? So, maybe we'll have to go to the bus stop to count how many people, how many passengers, you know, boarded the buses on a particular time source, you know. And, and, and so fieldwork is something we're looking to do. Data request is something we will work on as well. We're going to write to the government. But again, week 5 to 6 could be a little bit late, you know, if you got a 7-week extension, you know. That's already, like, the end of the semester. But again, this is a general, kind of, tentative roadmap, just to give you a sense of what we're trying to do here.

In terms of workload, I think, in general, GE course shouldn't be too heavy, right? Compared to your, to your major course. So, so I think we are trying to make this course manageable, all right? And there will be a lot of support during the class, so, you know, everybody will get… the job done. We'll get something, you know, a good outcome out of this course.

## Student Background Survey

And, just a quick, kind of, survey. How many of you are from math or science background? Raise your hand. 1, 2… Okay, so the rest of you from accounting? Computer Science, then you have your science, right? Okay, so again, how many of you are from science, including computer science and math? Oh, okay. Well, how about you? Communication. Okay. Well, I think these days, communication, people need to learn computer science as well, right? How about you? Yeah. Right. Right, that's… that's a good question.

So, I think the general question here is, this is a course offered by the math department, right? So, how friendly it is to students from, you know, not-so-strong math background? Well… I think the general question… the general answer to this question is that you shouldn't worry too much. Because, number one, this is a course called… taught by Talia and me, and I'm a language teacher, so, I only had got… I only did high school math, so, you know, a little bit… a little bit calculus in college. But you can consider me as a person from non-math background. And we are going to make sure that this course will be accessible to students with very little math background, okay?

And another important aspect is that now we have AI. Okay? We have AI on our side, so, especially for coding, you know, we need to write some programming codes in this course. But most of the coding can actually be done through vibe coding, so to speak, these days. Everybody's talking about vibe coding. So basically, you talk to AI, you know, in natural language, what you want for a computer program to work, and then the AI will write a program for you, and all you have to do is to copy and paste. It's not… It's not exactly that way, but it's pretty close, right? So it's almost like, even if you don't know much about programming, you can start doing programming. Of course, at the end of the day, you still… you still have to learn a little bit more about the… the programming, right? You can't just say, oh, this is the text, you just… just run the codes, but… But anyway, so, so going back to your question, I don't think you have to worry that much, because… you know, we are here to support you.

## Assessment Breakdown

And, yeah. Now, in terms of the assessment. We have a group project that would count 30% of the final grades, so we are expecting something like 4 to 5 students working as a group. Alright, so, but right now, we'll probably form two groups. We'll see how many students will be here next Tuesday to decide. So that's 30%, which, which is… kind of, like, the… the… the capstone thing, the final project.

And there will be in-class exercises in week 3 and week 4. Alright, so that's important. You need to come for some in-class exercise that would take account for 10%.

The group presentation would be… closely connected to the project. So basically, you… you did your project, you… write your report, and then you need to present it. All right, so there will be two rounds of presentation. The first round is more like a rehearsal. The second round, we are still, planning this, but we might go to the Legislative Council to do it. Okay, so let me show you a link. So, this is a Facebook post. So, we had a… meeting with Dr. Wendy Hong last December. Talia was here, was there. So this is my other GE course, right? So we did… a presentation like this. Right? Okay. So hopefully… well, we haven't confirmed it yet, but hopefully, we will be doing something similar. Okay? Alright, so that's… that's the presentation.

And then… We have some very short, reflective essay you need to write. Okay? And that would account for 20%, and that's the individual work, because we try to balance the group work with individual work. The group project and presentation would be group work, but then the reflective essay would be individual work.

And then there's something unique in this course is that we also expect you to write a Human-AI Collaboration Report. Because in this course, we're going to use AI quite extensively. Not just to generate text, but to generate codes. Right? So, I'm sure that you will have a lot of experience of using AI in this course, and unlike some other courses where teachers are more cautious and try to warn you against not using AI in this way or that way, we are more positive on the use of AI. Of course, we still uphold the ethical standards and plagiarism is not tolerated in this course, just like any other courses. But, we're going to take a more proactive approach to the using of AI. We want to teach you how to use AI in some new ways. So that's why we actually put Human-AI Collaboration Report as one of the assessment components right here. Alright, so… That would make the individual and group assessment exactly 50% versus 50%, okay? I think that's a pretty balanced arrangement, you know. You can work together, get support from your peers, but then at the same time, you will be able to make your individual efforts to try to do well in these schools.

Any questions about the course so far? You know, the first two weeks, usually, we just introduce the course, people shop around. Hopefully the course is sufficiently interesting to you. And, yeah. Talia, you have something to add? Sure, you do that first, and then I will go back to talk about my week one stuff. Okay.

**Talia:** Okay. Alright. So, I think I pretty much covered the course objective, right? So the key thing is to evaluate the government staff's practices of policy analysis and policy making. And to see to what extent the data is playing a role. Our initial impression is that only to a limited extent the government is using the data. So, we have a mission. Alright? So all the students taking this course, we are, as a team, we are on a… on a mission. Our mission is to find out to what extent the government is using the data to make decisions, and most likely, the answer would be quite disappointing, and therefore, we are going to do research, we're going to do math model to show people, to make the argument that, actually, the government can do a better job. Okay? So it won't be a happy story for the government. You see what I mean? But it's going to be an important argument for our society. Because the message is clear: if we want better decisions, better policies, we have to adopt the data-driven approach. And this is what this course is about.

## Technology and Mathematical Modeling

**Simon Wang:** Okay. Alright? So, I think I pretty much covered the course objective, right? So the key thing is to evaluate the government staff's practices of policy analysis and policy making. And to see to what extent the data is playing a role. Our initial impression is that only to a limited extent the government is using the data. So, we have a mission. Alright? So all the students taking this course, we are, as a team, we are on a… on a mission. Our mission is to find out to what extent the government is using the data to make decisions, and most likely, the answer would be quite disappointing, and therefore, we are going to do research, we're going to do math model to show people, to make the argument that, actually, the government can do a better job. Okay? So it won't be a happy story for the government. You see what I mean? But it's going to be an important argument for our society. Because the message is clear: if we want better decisions, better policies, we have to adopt the data-driven approach. And this is what this course is about.

**Simon Wang:** Alright? Now, in terms of… Well, we have the assessment part, and then if you click on this, we got a roadmap. So, yeah, I don't want to spend too much time here because, you know, Talia has got other things to cover as well. I have something to cover as well, something more specific. But, this is basically a kind of like a tentative plan, you know, as I said earlier, this is the first time we teach this course. We're trying to set things up and figure things out, so please be patient with us. But, as you can see, we got the course instruction, this week, and then we will start learning some AI tools, and learning some
