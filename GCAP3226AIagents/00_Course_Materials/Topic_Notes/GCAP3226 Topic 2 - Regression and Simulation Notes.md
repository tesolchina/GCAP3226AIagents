> **Date**: September 26, 2025

## Overview
Bus stop merger analysis presents rich opportunities for quantitative modeling, combining spatial analysis, accessibility metrics, and operational optimization to inform urban transport planning decisions.

## üìä Regression Analysis Applications

### 1. Distance-Ridership Relationship Models
**Primary Model:**
```
Ridership = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ(Walking_Distance) + Œ≤‚ÇÇ(Age_Profile) + Œ≤‚ÇÉ(Disability_Rate) + Œ≤‚ÇÑ(Weather_Factor) + Œ≤‚ÇÖ(Peak_Hours) + Œµ
```

**Key Variables:**
- **Dependent**: Daily ridership counts, boarding rates by time period
- **Independent**: Walking distance to merged stop, demographic composition, accessibility infrastructure
- **Controls**: Weather conditions, special events, seasonal variations

**Expected Findings:**
- Negative relationship between walking distance and ridership
- Stronger negative effect for elderly and disabled populations
- Interaction effects between distance and demographic vulnerability

### 2. Accessibility Impact Models
**Logistic Regression Framework:**
```
P(Accessibility_Barrier) = 1 / (1 + e^-(Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅX‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇX‚ÇÇ + ... + Œ≤‚ÇñX‚Çñ))
```

**Target Outcomes:**
- Probability of experiencing accessibility barriers
- Likelihood of switching to alternative transport modes
- Risk of transport exclusion for vulnerable groups

**Predictor Variables:**
- Additional walking distance required
- Physical mobility indicators (age, disability status)
- Weather sensitivity factors
- Availability of alternative routes

### 3. Cost-Benefit Regression Analysis
**Multi-level Model:**
```
Net_Benefit = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ(Operational_Savings) + Œ≤‚ÇÇ(Accessibility_Costs) + Œ≤‚ÇÉ(Service_Quality) + Œ≤‚ÇÑ(External_Effects) + Œµ
```

**Components:**
- **Operational Savings**: Reduced maintenance, simplified routing, staff efficiency
- **Accessibility Costs**: Increased travel time, lost ridership, equity impacts
- **Service Quality**: Waiting times, crowding, shelter availability
- **External Effects**: Traffic flow, urban design, property values

## üéØ Simulation Modeling Applications

### 1. Pedestrian Flow Simulation
**Agent-Based Modeling Framework:**
- **Agents**: Individual passengers with diverse mobility characteristics
- **Environment**: Street network, sidewalk capacity, weather conditions
- **Behaviors**: Route choice, walking speed variations, accessibility needs

**Simulation Scenarios:**
- Peak hour pedestrian flows to merged stops
- Impact of weather conditions on walking patterns
- Crowding effects at consolidated waiting areas
- Emergency evacuation scenarios

**Key Metrics:**
- Average walking times by demographic group
- Pedestrian congestion levels
- Accessibility compliance under different configurations

### 2. Queuing Theory Models
**Mathematical Framework:**
```
System: M/M/c queuing model for bus boarding processes
- M: Poisson arrival process (passengers)
- M: Exponential service times (boarding)
- c: Number of buses serving the merged stop
```

**Simulation Parameters:**
- Passenger arrival rates (time-varying)
- Bus service frequencies for different routes
- Boarding time distributions by passenger type
- Platform capacity constraints

**Performance Indicators:**
- Average waiting times
- Queue length distributions
- Service level degradation risks
- Optimal bus scheduling for merged operations

### 3. Monte Carlo Optimization
**Optimization Problem:**
```
Minimize: Total_Social_Cost = Operational_Cost + Accessibility_Cost + External_Cost
Subject to: Service_Quality_Constraints, Accessibility_Standards, Budget_Limits
```

**Uncertainty Factors:**
- Ridership demand variations
- Weather impact on walking behavior
- Construction and maintenance costs
- Demographic change projections

**Simulation Process:**
1. Generate random scenarios for uncertain parameters
2. Evaluate merger outcomes under each scenario
3. Calculate probability distributions for key performance metrics
4. Identify robust solutions across multiple scenarios

### 4. Traffic Impact Simulation
**Microsimulation Model:**
- **Scope**: Local traffic network including merged bus stop area
- **Components**: Vehicle movements, bus operations, pedestrian crossings
- **Interactions**: Bus dwell times, traffic signal coordination, pedestrian phases

**Analysis Outputs:**
- Traffic flow disruption during bus operations
- Intersection performance changes
- Overall network efficiency impacts
- Safety implications for pedestrian crossings
