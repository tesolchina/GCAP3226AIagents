### **3. Enhanced Collaboration Frameworks (Universal)**

**A. Specific Role Definitions & Responsibilities:**

*   **Project Manager (PM):**
    *   Owns and updates the `Project_Plan_and_Gantt_Chart.gsheet`.
    *   Schedules all team and supervisor meetings.
    *   Acts as the *sole* point of contact for Drs. Wu and Wang to streamline communication.
    *   Monitors task progress and flags risks/blockers.
    *   Facilitates meetings and ensures agendas are followed.
*   **Lead Researcher - Primary Data:**
    *   Owns the `Government_Enquiry` process from drafting to follow-up.
    *   Maintains the `Correspondence_Log.gsheet`.
    *   Responsible for understanding the Code on Access to Information.
*   **Lead Researcher(s) - Secondary Data:**
    *   Leads the search and organization of all non-government-provided data.
    *   Populates the `01_Data_Collection/Secondary_Data/` folder.
    *   Owns the literature review and contributes heavily to the "The Reality" section.
    *   Creates and maintains the `Data_Dictionary.gsheet` to explain all variables.
*   **Lead Analyst - Mathematical Model:**
    *   Primary liaison with Dr. Wu.
    *   Responsible for all code in `02_Analysis_and_Modeling/`.
    *   Must heavily document all code, data cleaning steps, and model assumptions.
    *   Writes the first draft of the "Methodology" and "The Ideal" sections.
*   **Lead Writer & Editor:**
    *   Primary liaison with Dr. Wang.
    *   Creates the `0_Outline_and_Structure.gdoc` for the report.
    *   Assembles individual sections into the `Z_Master_Draft_v1.gdoc`.
    *   Leads the Week 12 editing process for tone, clarity, grammar, and citations.

**B. Communication Protocols:**

*   **Weekly Sync (1 hour):** Agenda-driven meeting led by the PM. Review past week's progress, plan next week's tasks, resolve blockers.
*   **Daily Stand-up (15 mins, via text/chat):** Each member posts: 1) What I did yesterday, 2) What I will do today, 3) Any blockers.
*   **Tool:** Use a dedicated Slack/WhatsApp channel. Pin important documents like the Project Plan.
*   **Decision Making:** Use a "propose and consult" model. The relevant lead proposes a course of action (e.g., model choice), consults the team, and makes a final call. PM breaks ties.

**C. Progress Tracking System:**

*   Use a simple Kanban board (Trello, Asana, or a Google Sheet template).
*   Columns: `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Blocked`, `In Review`, `Done`.
*   Each task should be a "card" assigned to a specific person with a due date.

**D. Conflict Resolution Strategy:**

1.  **Level 1: Direct Conversation:** Members involved discuss the issue privately and seek a mutual solution.
2.  **Level 2: Mediated Discussion:** If unresolved, the Project Manager facilitates a discussion to find a compromise.
3.  **Level 3: Supervisor Escalation:** If the conflict impedes project progress, the PM brings the issue to the supervisors for a final decision.

### **1. Enhanced Project Roadmaps & Team-Specific Guidance**

Here are the detailed roadmaps for each team.

---

### **Team 1: Flu Shot Campaign Analysis**

**Refined Research Question:** To what extent do demographic factors (age, district), clinic accessibility, and campaign marketing spend predict flu vaccination rates in Hong Kong? What is the optimal resource allocation strategy to increase overall vaccination rates by 5% among high-risk populations?

#### **Weekly Roadmap**
| Week | Key Task & Actionable Steps | Deliverable | Risk Management | QA Checkpoint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5** | **Scoping & Planning:**<br>- Refine research question.<br>- PM creates Gantt chart.<br>- Draft Gov Enquiry email (see template).<br>- Start lit review on public health campaign effectiveness. | Project Plan & Draft Enquiry Email | **Risk:** Scope is too broad.<br>**Mitigation:** Focus on a specific demographic (e.g., elderly) or a specific year. | Supervisor review of plan & email. |
| **6** | **Data Quest:**<br>- Send approved email to Dept. of Health.<br>- Scrape CHP website for historical flu stats.<br>- Find Census data on demographics by district.<br>- Find locations of vaccination clinics on a map. | Sent email copy & Bibliography | **Risk:** No response from DH.<br>**Mitigation:** Plan to use publicly available aggregate data. This makes simulation more important. | PM confirms email sent & biblio is in Google Drive. |
| **7** | **Model Selection:**<br>- Consolidate all secondary data.<br>- **Decision Point:** Choose model. **Regression** is strong here. Predict `Vaccination_Rate` using `Age`, `District_Income`, `Clinic_Density`, `Campaign_Timing`. | 1-para model justification | **Risk:** Data is not granular enough.<br>**Mitigation:** Use district-level data as the unit of analysis. | Dr. Wu approves model choice. |
| **8-9** | **Modeling "The Ideal":**<br>- Lead Analyst cleans and merges datasets.<br>- Build multiple linear regression model.<br>- Interpret coefficients (e.g., "A 10% increase in clinic density in a district predicts a 1.2% increase in vaccination rate"). | Preliminary model results (R-squared, coefficients) & draft Methodology | **Risk:** Model has low predictive power.<br>**Mitigation:** Brainstorm new variables (e.g., proximity to MTR). | Team peer-reviews model code for clarity and bugs. Dr. Wu reviews results. |
| **10** | **Gap Analysis:**<br>- Compare model findings to DH's public campaign strategy (from press releases/reports).<br>- **Example Gap:** "Our model shows District A has low uptake despite high-risk population, but DH resources are evenly spread. The gap is a lack of targeted allocation." | Bullet-point summary of gaps | **Risk:** Can't find info on current DH strategy.<br>**Mitigation:** Infer strategy from public actions. State this as a limitation. | Lead Researchers review analysis for accuracy. |
| **11**| **Drafting Recommendations:**<br>- Formulate recommendations: 1) Re-allocate mobile vaccination clinics to districts identified by the model. 2) Target ad campaigns based on demographic profiles. 3) Propose a dynamic dashboard for DH to monitor uptake in real-time. | Full first draft of report | **Risk:** Recommendations are too generic.<br>**Mitigation:** Tie every recommendation directly to a finding from your model. | Dr. Wang reviews argumentation and structure. |
| **12**| **Editing & Consolidation:**<br>- Lead Writer leads a full-team read-through.<br>- Edit for a single, consistent voice.<br>- Check all citations and data visualizations. | Near-final report | **Risk:** Inconsistent sections.<br>**Mitigation:** Use the master document and track changes. | Entire team signs off on the draft. |
| **13**| **Finalization:**<br>- Final proofread by at least two members.<br>- PM submits final report.<br>- Prepare 10-minute presentation summarizing the Reality, Ideal, Gap, and Recommendations. | Final Report & Presentation Slides | - | Final check of rubric requirements. |

---

### **Team 2: Bus Route Coordination**

**Refined Research Question:** Using Route 56 as a case study, how can passenger demand be accurately predicted using time-of-day, weather, and demographic data? How can a simulation model optimize bus frequency to reduce average passenger wait time by 15% without increasing operational costs by more than 5%?

#### **Weekly Roadmap**
| Week | Key Task & Actionable Steps | Deliverable | Risk Management | QA Checkpoint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5** | **Scoping & Planning:**<br>- Confirm focus on Route 56 using course data.<br>- PM creates Gantt chart.<br>- Draft Gov Enquiry for supplementary data (see template).<br>- Review literature on transport optimization. | Project Plan & Draft Enquiry Email | **Risk:** Over-reliance on course data.<br>**Mitigation:** Actively seek new data (weather, events) to enrich the existing dataset. | Supervisor review of plan & email. |
| **6** | **Data Quest:**<br>- Send email to Transport Dept.<br>- Download historical weather data for HK.<br>- Research population density around Route 56.<br>- Use course-provided Route 56 simulation data as baseline. | Sent email copy & Bibliography | **Risk:** TD denies request for Octopus data.<br>**Mitigation:** Your project is still viable with the provided simulation data. Frame it as a proof-of-concept. | PM confirms all data is organized in Drive. |
| **7** | **Model Selection:**<br>- **Decision Point:** Use **both**. 1) **Regression** to predict passenger demand (`Passengers_per_hour`) at key stops. 2) **Simulation** to model the entire route system using the demand predictions as input. | 1-para model justification | **Risk:** Integrating two models is complex.<br>**Mitigation:** Start with regression. Use its output to feed the simulation. | Dr. Wu approves the dual-model approach. |
| **8-9** | **Modeling "The Ideal":**<br>- **Regression:** Predict demand using `Time_of_Day`, `Day_of_Week`, `Is_Holiday`, `Rainfall_mm`.<br>- **Simulation:** Build a discrete-event simulation. Agents: Passengers & Buses. Events: Passenger Arrives, Bus Arrives, Bus Departs. Test different frequency schedules. | Regression results & initial simulation model + documentation | **Risk:** Simulation is too slow or complex.<br>**Mitigation:** Simplify assumptions first (e.g., constant travel time between stops). Add complexity later. | Team peer-reviews simulation logic. Dr. Wu reviews model structure. |
| **10**| **Gap Analysis:**<br>- Compare current Route 56 timetable ("The Reality") with your simulation's optimal schedule.<br>- **Example Gap:** "The current schedule has fixed 15-min intervals. Our model suggests 10-min intervals during peak rain and 20-min during off-peak, reducing overall wait time and saving fuel." | Bullet-point summary of gaps with supporting charts | **Risk:** The "Ideal" is not practical.<br>**Mitigation:** Add constraints to your simulation (e.g., max number of buses available). | Lead Analyst validates the comparison metrics (wait time, cost). |
| **11**| **Drafting Recommendations:**<br>- Formulate recommendations: 1) Implement a dynamic timetable for Route 56 based on the regression model's demand forecast. 2) Propose a pilot program to test this schedule. 3) Suggest installing passenger counters for real-time data collection. | Full first draft of report | **Risk:** Recommendations ignore driver schedules/union rules.<br>**Mitigation:** Acknowledge these as "areas for further study" and focus on the data-driven evidence. | Dr. Wang reviews the narrative flow from problem to solution. |
| **12**| **Editing & Consolidation:**<br>- Lead Writer merges sections.<br>- Check that all graphs are labeled and interpreted in the text.<br>- Ensure the link between the regression and simulation is clear. | Near-final report | **Risk:** Technical sections are unreadable.<br>**Mitigation:** The Lead Analyst must explain the model in plain language for the intro/conclusion. | Entire team reviews for clarity. |
| **13**| **Finalization:**<br>- Final proofread.<br>- PM submits report.<br>- Prepare presentation focusing on the simulation output and potential savings. | Final Report & Presentation Slides | - | Final check of rubric requirements. |

### **5. Mathematical Modeling Guidance (Team-Specific)**

**Team 3: Typhoon Preparedness**
*   **Regression Model:**
    *   **Goal:** Predict the "impact" of a typhoon to justify signal timing.
    *   **Dependent Variable (Y):** A composite "Impact Score" you create (e.g., sum of normalized values for injuries, fallen trees, economic loss) or a single metric like `Number_of_Emergency_Calls`.
    *   **Independent Variables (X):** `Max_Wind_Speed`, `Rainfall_mm`, `Storm_Surge_Height`, `Lead_Time_of_T8_Signal` (in hours before landfall).
    *   **Insight:** You could find that `Lead_Time_of_T8_Signal` has a significant negative coefficient, suggesting that earlier warnings reduce impact.
*   **Simulation Model:**
    *   **Goal:** Model emergency resource allocation.
    *   **System:** A map of Hong Kong with vulnerable areas and resource depots.
    *   **Agents:** Emergency crews, shelter staff.
    *   **Scenarios:** Simulate a typhoon striking. Test different resource pre-deployment strategies. "If we move 50% of Kowloon's crews to the New Territories 12 hours before landfall, what is the change in average response time to incidents?"

**Team 4: Municipal Solid Waste Charging**
*   **Regression Model:**
    *   **Goal:** Predict waste generation.
    *   **Dependent Variable (Y):** `Avg_Weekly_Waste_kg_per_Household`.
    *   **Independent Variables (X):** `Proposed_Charge_per_Bag`, `Median_District_Income`, `Household_Size`, `Building_Type` (Public/Private), `Recycling_Facility_Density`.
    *   **Insight:** This model will help you estimate the price elasticity of waste generation. A key finding for your recommendations.
*   **Simulation Model (Agent-Based):**
    *   **Goal:** Model household behavior under different policy rules.
    *   **Agents:** Households with different attributes (income, environmental consciousness).
    *   **Rules:** "If charge > $X, household will try to recycle Y% more." or "If illegal dumping fines are low and enforcement is rare, Z% of low-income households may resort to it."
    *   **Scenarios:** Test different bag prices, rebate schemes, and enforcement levels to find an optimal policy mix that maximizes waste reduction while minimizing negative social impacts.

**Team 5: Green @ Community**
*   **Regression Model:**
    *   **Goal:** Identify factors driving program success.
    *   **Dependent Variable (Y):** `Monthly_Recyclables_kg` or `Monthly_Visitors` per facility.
    *   **Independent Variables (X):** `Facility_Size_sqm`, `Staff_Count`, `Proximity_to_MTR`, `District_Population_Density`, `District_Median_Income`, `Years_in_Operation`.
    *   **Insight:** You might find that `Proximity_to_MTR` is a far stronger predictor of success than `Staff_Count`, suggesting location is more critical than staffing levels for resource allocation.
*   **Simulation Model:**
    *   **Goal:** Optimize the location of new facilities.
    *   **System:** A map of a district with population data.
    *   **Scenarios:** Place a hypothetical new facility at different locations (A, B, C). Simulate "citizen agents" traveling to their nearest facility. The model can calculate the total distance traveled by all citizens or the total population served within a 10-minute walk.
    *   **Output:** A "heatmap" showing the best locations for a new facility to maximize community reach.

**Team 6: Bus Stop Merge**
*   **Regression Model:**
    *   **Goal:** Predict the importance of a bus stop.
    *   **Dependent Variable (Y):** `Daily_Boarding_Count`.
    *   **Independent Variables (X):** `Distance_to_Next_Stop`, `Number_of_Bus_Routes_Serving`, `Proximity_to_POI` (e.g., hospital, MTR, school), `Local_Population_Density`.
    *   **Insight:** This helps you create a data-driven "Stop Importance Score." Low-scoring stops that are close to other high
